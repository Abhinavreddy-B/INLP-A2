1095.9393310546875
she was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	465.5129089355469
my situation in life, my connections
with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	562.6513671875
"my dear friend,

     "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.	1606.2662353515625
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	119.37627410888672
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	6925.78125
are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"	170.49560546875
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	4.88222074508667
their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	121.02349853515625
but they did pass away, and mr and
mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn.	800.0682983398438
"i hope, my dear," said mr bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	259.0915222167969
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	394.15423583984375
she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley's inattention.	52.60250473022461
"what is it you mean?"	233.69149780273438
"oh!	27.04831314086914
i grieve to
     find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared w. was not a man to be trusted.	461.74359130859375
one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	293.47119140625
he generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	3355.22998046875
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	1538.521728515625
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	341.85162353515625
mr gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	363.8963928222656
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."	813.8212280273438
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."	1294.70068359375
"sometimes.	532.9228515625
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same;
and mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss
bennet.	533.861572265625
this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	662.4957275390625
he spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided.	162.2254180908203
she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	1207.8580322265625
colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	207.4076690673828
"but why all this secrecy?	1228.0823974609375
"thank you--but i always mend my own."	122.86739349365234
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."	258.74005126953125
"it is well.	65.46625518798828
how mr darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	34.523136138916016
and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,

"dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr collins must excuse
me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	227.9639129638672
1.f.4.	288.9852294921875
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy,
were to entertain each other.	486.19268798828125
she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will
be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my
good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage
every thing.	154.25302124023438
no, no, this is not likely.	395.0536193847656
her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	1865.9278564453125
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	94.21446228027344
ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!	96.33290100097656
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	346.864501953125
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	1487.5047607421875
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	90.66622161865234
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	2587.025390625
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	257.96783447265625
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	201.2364501953125
i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	111.9405517578125
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	5337.96435546875
_you_
may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer."	2617.897216796875
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	105.6070556640625
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	149.496826171875
elizabeth smiled.	127.49009704589844
they have at
least that advantage."	222.09278869628906
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	623.08642578125
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	227.73780822753906
must it be so?"	144.51370239257812
"sure he
will not leave london before he has found them.	640.239013671875
why does she not come in?"	380.26336669921875
everything wore
a happier aspect.	341.21746826171875
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."	608.8784790039062
but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable.	1225.995361328125
the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	515.47216796875
he observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it
is above eight months.	326.992431640625
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	435.9173583984375
but your
_family_ owe me nothing.	7236.52978515625
u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.	21418.974609375
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	413.7975158691406
"i am trying to make it out."	96.08894348144531
i do not wish to avoid the walk.	192.5628662109375
nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the united states.	254.1070098876953
i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	597.5887451171875
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	991.4760131835938
how can mr bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	1042.206787109375
with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."	535.305908203125
well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man mr stone.	521.6483764648438
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	387.89617919921875
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	516.9796142578125
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	477.565185546875
i will
think no more about him."	90.7540283203125
"i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	1430.537841796875
let wickham
be _your_ man.	46635.31640625
i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	3691.08056640625
after making
     every possible enquiry on that side london, colonel f. came on into
     hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.	897.4600219726562
"yes, ma'am, all."	71.04228210449219
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects.	962.1282958984375
do not distress me by the idea.	372.87408447265625
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	5194.07080078125
let me hear what it is."	13.917867660522461
it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	178.38290405273438
we want none of them;
do we?"	897.265869140625
"where is your sister?"	17.869726181030273
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	692.6722412109375
cried his wife impatiently.	480.68438720703125
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	3837.044189453125
whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."	52.06744384765625
but he found lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	2483.078857421875
her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	966.7039184570312
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	121.24998474121094
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and mr collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	217.52175903320312
mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	4472.6865234375
adieu to disappointment and spleen.	309.2630920410156

updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

after
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	567.9600219726562
he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	1484.8599853515625
"if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes."	583.0109252929688
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	625.669189453125
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."	79.6496353149414
it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	523.6206665039062
they then went away.	92.44925689697266
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	241.39772033691406
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	209.21119689941406
the one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	2195.02197265625
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	200.53192138671875
an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	61.58662414550781
_you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	1834.01123046875
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come."	2733.504150390625
do not repeat what i then said.	438.0725402832031
this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	2645.309326171875
a low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	314.9858703613281
i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."	503.65228271484375
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said,

"i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	367.9473571777344
i do not trust my own
partiality.	1379.47314453125
"you must not blame my aunt.	1577.9737548828125
and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose?	310.9913635253906
"not at all."	36.88808822631836
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	612.7381591796875
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"well, jane, who is it from?	214.72518920898438
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	663.7542724609375
"are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"	737.0317993164062
you do not look
well.	79.78894805908203
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	139.1072998046875
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	734.0046997070312
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	1218.9368896484375
"and have you heard from him often?"	298.0572814941406
after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer.	273.44244384765625
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the
head quarters.	640.7600708007812
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	230.99282836914062
with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	815.50634765625
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends.	595.0711669921875
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	1387.227783203125
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!	173.23263549804688
lady catherine, sir william, and mr and mrs collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her
party.	261.25225830078125
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt
that i _should_ be looked at.	269.3696594238281
mrs bennet said only, "nonsense,
nonsense!"	359.789306640625
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	367.1219177246094
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"	799.7952270507812
if you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."	148.60980224609375
and so would anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	2305.142822265625
wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	266.5906677246094
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	162.77821350097656
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour, till sir william thus began.	1612.974365234375
about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	3079.02294921875
"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	1364.386962890625
lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	886.5611572265625
but i knew i should
persuade you at last.	210.911376953125
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	67.19732666015625
you blamed me for coming?"	196.19873046875
i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better."	71.1911849975586
my dear jane, mr collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	78.40078735351562
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."	679.9053344726562
you promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	68.71768951416016
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	456.2083740234375
very odd!--and you only the
second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your
younger sisters must be very young?"	303.5965576171875
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty.	193.9646453857422
five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs
bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	244.87298583984375
if
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	1343.6998291015625
there was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	4131.421875
give me farther particulars.	19848.00390625
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	464.5483093261719
mr darcy!	30.19529914855957
let me do it without farther loss of time.	3541.494873046875
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	130.39263916015625
_hunsford, near westerham, kent,

     15th october._

     dear sir,

     the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the
     misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"there, mrs bennet."	700.4810791015625

is it true?"	551.5032348632812
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."	535.9400634765625

mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	463.0230407714844
colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	551.0585327148438
"and is this all?"	219.0228271484375
all that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the london road.	1000.1088256835938
when my niece georgiana went to
ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady
anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i
am excessively attentive to all those things.	767.6123046875
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	577.7957763671875
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	144.5753936767578
mr gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	3232.15380859375
his countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	873.2176513671875
but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	2533.541015625
every thing being settled between _them_, mr darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	559.697509765625
it was agreed to.	48.638614654541016
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth,

"i am glad you are come back, lizzy."	444.2156677246094
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	223.37258911132812
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	2864.53076171875
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	5451.79736328125
"lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say.	31.33088493347168

but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	344.3465881347656
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	343.6554870605469
lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	584.1251831054688
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr darcy," she cried; "i
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	1046.0748291015625
he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	194.58290100097656
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."	1001.9871826171875
it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	282.6506652832031
but, lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or jane at most.	919.93212890625
she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	1609.4962158203125
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	114.61914825439453
"so much the better.	72.88565063476562
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	7689.45458984375
"of what are you talking?"	31.260210037231445
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	226.33131408691406
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her."	222.28402709960938
perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.	1084.8492431640625
she was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr
wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	547.9730834960938
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what
say you to the day?	175.0054931640625
"that is very strange.	37.2844123840332
if elizabeth, when mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	622.9043579101562
the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	4156.3427734375
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	462.2705383300781
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	633.01904296875
"but to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	903.7376708984375
--and
upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
mr collins."	1068.133544921875
"can you deny that you have done it?"	68.79595184326172
"after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	509.71484375
"i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	327.0615234375
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.	77.90363311767578
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.	1047.0823974609375
"you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	109.64746856689453
they will have nothing else to
do."	18.693822860717773
"this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	1265.420166015625
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	209.59591674804688
it was to this effect:

     "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.	1298.5380859375
"one of them does."	241.94163513183594
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	1108.0831298828125
i will try again.	95.8033218383789
but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	699.1076049804688
when mr collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	2070.6015625
he was on one side of her mother.	76.76104736328125
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	352.5917053222656
sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	1055.2965087890625
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	40.9711799621582
she got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	436.0705871582031
"if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as
you.	138.7234344482422
a lively imagination soon settled it all.	982.6079711914062
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	175.73391723632812
by many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	560.3907470703125
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	746.6971435546875
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr
bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	385.6910400390625
but it is all, all too late now."	528.1720581054688
good heaven!	1813.68701171875
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs gardiner, "i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	150.4390411376953
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my
cards."	323.2278747558594
but
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	707.6615600585938
"dear sir,

     "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	824.3917846679688
"do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	622.5699462890625
he expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	368.7794189453125
such a charming man!--so handsome!	487.1104736328125
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr darcy!"	171.49900817871094
but i confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	280.8963623046875
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project
gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	4384.8974609375
she is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--your's, &c.

     "e.	248.9639892578125
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	1494.727294921875
she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	364.0140686035156
"i mention it, because it is the living which i ought to have had.	1150.9678955078125
"dearest jane!	632.3734130859375
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	410.23992919921875
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable
house.	73832.8125
the path just admitted three.	658.0228881835938
to mrs gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	337.7001647949219
you both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	3870.293212890625
though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	292.2785339355469
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	726.8941040039062
my object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise."	37.11052703857422
"yes, almost every day."	847.7548217773438
such a disappointment!	806.1387939453125
i send no compliments to your
mother.	149.39654541015625
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	327.556884765625
not handsome enough to dance with!	24.531719207763672
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know."	146.40185546875
"my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you.	305.5351867675781
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do."	70.75802612304688
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	371.40478515625
elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley.	210.47706604003906
"i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	6806.9716796875
_their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	74.50767517089844
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	130.65179443359375
elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name.	1068.6522216796875
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	2218.04931640625
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	343.1686706542969
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	124.17495727539062
i wonder what he can be doing there."	1166.1209716796875
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough.	61.224281311035156
"and do you really know all this?"	357.365966796875
it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	165.6785888671875
we do not suffer by _accident_.	235.76202392578125
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	209.69497680664062
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	27.04831314086914
"oh!	519.3026123046875
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	241.74363708496094
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	17057.033203125
in
understanding darcy was the superior.	557.16650390625
but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	1125.0628662109375
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more
than i ever look into."	231.07037353515625
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	930.9273071289062
"why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	163.46246337890625
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr
bennet coolly observed,

"from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	1297.352294921875
we will go round the park every day.	212.0146942138672
you had much better
dance."	22628.1484375
why must their
marriage be private?	613.9478149414062
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	446.40106201171875
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	213.4331512451172
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	361.62213134765625
for your
sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss
bennet?"	521.7929077148438
"not so hasty, if you please.	346.2662658691406
you will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	45.389549255371094
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	1496.7777099609375
many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	447.4237365722656
they were all astonished; and mr bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."	82.849609375
you have done all this!	508.8333435058594
after a short pause,
her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	191.3473358154297
it was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	1531.556396484375
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley."	450.789306640625
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."	11.00253677368164
darcy made no answer.	400.1858215332031
he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	793.2110595703125
from
what can it proceed?	5741.51025390625
for
my part, mr bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	14263.025390625
compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	130.61180114746094
"undoubtedly.	510.0973205566406
he
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	145.05178833007812
it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	185.1703643798828
_i_ did for you.	570.1729125976562
there are a lot of things you can do with project
gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic
works.	223.08984375
"if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.	1653.102294921875
lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	1006.372802734375
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	986.7275390625
"you need not distress yourself.	1069.68505859375
the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	891.392822265625
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.	348.5544738769531
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	820.888427734375
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	36.75075912475586
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to
say.	736.000732421875
she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	302.6971740722656
"she
looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	43.475555419921875
she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	687.6243286132812
these
were the contents:

     "my dear harriet,

     "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
     missed.	834.078369140625
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."	36.97135543823242
i did not wink at you."	8057.08056640625
what will wickham say?	1042.3922119140625
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "ah!	135.87989807128906
"perhaps we might be deceived."	340.0534973144531
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	89.2548828125
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	2959.131103515625
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	4990.63232421875
"but consider your daughters.	1207.4296875
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	42.51853561401367
we must not make him desperate."	104.44519805908203
but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	274.6908874511719
you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	291.6228332519531
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	665.0125732421875
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,"
said she, "though i am _not_ her particular friend.	363.5519104003906
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	131.716064453125
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."	647.8079223632812
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	49.379302978515625
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	81.73236083984375
"but what is to be
done about pemberley?"	32.47990417480469
"no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."	210.50546264648438
but his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	20.06326675415039
end of the second volume.	1889.8935546875
mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	67.6866226196289
very
nonsensical to come at all!	871.576171875
i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."	205.64283752441406
lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and mr collins, in describing the civility of mr and
mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	860.451904296875
nobody wants him to come.	242.3740692138672
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	126.5979995727539
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	226.63197326660156
any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.	537.691162109375
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."	13.024662017822266
"oh, lord!	345.76519775390625
but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr darcy walk into the
room.	67.14240264892578
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	40.91596984863281
the
other is miss de bourgh.	446.8646545410156
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	185.52793884277344
as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	154.36927795410156
cried bingley.	1164.913818359375
never, even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at
rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings.	196.70176696777344
mr collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	219.12759399414062
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	521.7120971679688
have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	54.63713455200195
they must have seen them together for ever."	84.81266021728516
how well
it sounds.	652.1967163085938
elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	83.89154815673828
this is your final resolve!	91.5965347290039
but do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	670.2050170898438
he could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	381.3041076660156
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	524.34521484375
can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?"	81.99205780029297
the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	349.3262023925781
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	263.4480895996094
let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."	2618.37548828125
this idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	119.07870483398438
if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them."	1869.4732666015625
jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	2109.67333984375
but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	853.2673950195312
there
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom mr darcy could have
such boundless influence.	127.31404113769531
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	606.68115234375
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	224.2214813232422
to mr bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	446.5232238769531
for such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	171.72698974609375
on distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	154.31341552734375
cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and mr darcy appeared.	59.16599655151367
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	106.36841583251953
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and
i hope you will consent to be of the party.	468.82647705078125
his behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	533.9176025390625
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	203.84112548828125
but now it was all too natural.	561.5634155273438
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	34.07618713378906
elizabeth now began to revive.	143.7398681640625
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	96.33042907714844
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	362.0089111328125
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	93.49103546142578
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	385.7140197753906
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	359.7105712890625
do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	251.50814819335938
kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	496.7071533203125
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	78.48285675048828
if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	153.09678649902344
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	765.1382446289062
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	8854.4931640625
my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	27.04831314086914
"oh!	437.7806396484375
i am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	98.3324966430664
i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	498.7287292480469
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."	337.66583251953125
as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	15.761012077331543
see
paragraph 1.c below.	157.31173706054688
"yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	41.74786376953125
my dear," continued mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	47.18000793457031
"yes.	945.6048583984375
he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	300.0357971191406
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."	377.9714660644531
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either.	220.32754516601562
on the following monday, mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at
longbourn.	56.96931838989258
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	575.0675048828125
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.	59.25600814819336
"yes, very well.	668.7840576171875
i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	188.11514282226562
"i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would
not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	768.3568115234375
"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	746.7801513671875
lady lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty.	159.67205810546875
but what does he say of the living?"	106.1615219116211
we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	138.55255126953125
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."	103.6175308227539
i am not romantic you know.	585.2545776367188
she
certainly did not hate him.	5124.81689453125
he was
angry.	704.790771484375
her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	348.8839111328125
it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you.	1111.0369873046875
my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	182.1598358154297
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of mr darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.	619.5714111328125
"they
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr bingley and his sisters."	1931.4691162109375
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	348.31378173828125
she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	6591.06640625
where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	163.64315795898438

pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."	68.62467193603516
she felt that she had no business at
pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	1280.42236328125
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	56.21198272705078
i don't know.	495.4302978515625
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!	431.55078125
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	31.485504150390625
"that it ought not to be attempted.	4660.88427734375
she stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	727.20751953125
"let her be called down.	69.13440704345703
and what sort of young lady is she?	585.07177734375
it was not all settled before monday: as soon
     as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn.	10.236763000488281

only four dances!	788.606201171875

humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn.	637.1152954101562

but i am at his disposal.	190.01622009277344
"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is
about."	263.89959716796875
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	158.21363830566406
but here he was set right by mrs bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	130.4813232421875
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	178.57241821289062
do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"	1470.2608642578125
she knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	8246.662109375
there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire."	116.34992218017578
she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	443.1605224609375
wickham is safe."	993.3906860351562
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"oh!	377.5017395019531
jane, i take your place now, and you must go
lower, because i am a married woman."	556.092529296875
i will put on my things in a moment.	786.5999755859375

pride & prejudice.	634.2853393554688
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	200.9047088623047
"it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	236.06642150878906
we had better not mention it.	334.4818115234375
"lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	985.239013671875
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, i am determined.	135.26483154296875
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	377.2864990234375
catherine and lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	327.0159606933594
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	47.44388198852539
"'tis too much!"	172.5361328125
since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	71.75049591064453
have not you always hated him?"	834.4738159179688
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	254.43569946289062
in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	701.342041015625
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucas's last week; and even mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least.	142.01344299316406
teaze him--laugh at
him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	6636.181640625
the visit
was returned in due form.	118.43801879882812
let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	38.00431823730469
but she would not be secure.	366.76702880859375
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	386.7697448730469
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
what to think."	385.648193359375
mrs bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	181.64122009277344
well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	287.3170471191406
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	165.33314514160156
you must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     project gutenberg-tm works.	302.3149108886719
mrs
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	153.5900421142578
your's, &c.

     "edw.	649.5778198242188
lady
catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.	261.1991882324219
lady catherine seemed resigned.	839.3068237304688
the miss
webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--do you draw?"	37900.546875
"neglect!	97.35762786865234
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	1570.583251953125
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	549.2217407226562
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"you, who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	100.1734848022461
we now come to the point.	339.7408447265625
i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance.	172.92611694335938
had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	214.5676727294922
you shall not defend her,
though it is charlotte lucas.	22.05794334411621
said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	89.76017761230469
mrs collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure."	110.8460464477539
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	191.71913146972656
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	341.8509826660156
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	938.4689331054688
his most particular
friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	118.1864013671875
she mentioned this to her friend miss
lucas.	107.04743957519531
there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."	241.82249450683594
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	729.807373046875
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	2904.3466796875
the person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.	400.7967529296875
thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	261.1907043457031
at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends."	300.82598876953125
he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	694.8920288085938
mrs hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	918.0923461914062
i never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	236.5965118408203
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild."	52.15630340576172
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	82.43315887451172
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	137.10516357421875
it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	117.13019561767578
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to
think."	654.6859130859375
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	82.66118621826172
if this be the case, he deserves you.	1478.4920654296875
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	593.00390625
her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	749.3076782226562
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	329.32928466796875
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	1790.989990234375
the younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's
dying an old maid.	163.41748046875
she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	168.1769561767578
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	295.1961669921875
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	222.09234619140625
putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	1789.7921142578125
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	488.3905334472656
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	1179.83642578125
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	407.3887939453125
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable.	461.7218017578125
he
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	290.9095153808594
there he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	1055.42919921875
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	396.1796875
but i can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."	27783.134765625
but gracious me!	384.4761962890625
how can they suit each other?--do you
know mr bingley?"	88.31314086914062
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	591.9984130859375
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy
had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	149.1866912841797
"we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	522.341552734375
she read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	246.83566284179688
that he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr gardiner.	392.882568359375
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	186.25143432617188
it was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	81.85111999511719
i am the happiest creature in
     the world.	708.1669311523438
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."	1572.41162109375
"neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	378.4355163574219
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	835.7799682617188
your sister i also watched.--her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have
     been in an error.	49.159603118896484
single, my dear, to be sure!	90.1349868774414
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."	537.8573608398438
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	45.090782165527344
dear, dear lizzy.	147.0965118408203
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	286.0911865234375
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."	375.6649169921875
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	1038.469970703125
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	770.18017578125
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.	185.79310607910156
he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."	381.3190612792969
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs
gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	2862.018310546875
i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	207.7978973388672
--said jane as she
finished it.	414.13507080078125
she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	997.6658935546875
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	935.3202514648438
not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr darcy
returned within the stated time.	439.4324645996094
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	27.04831314086914
"oh!	340.83758544921875
you agree that the foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage.	362.9512023925781
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	285.41522216796875
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	236.7767791748047
the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.	288.9852294921875
1.e.9.	206.5009765625
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs
philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	2180.125244140625
he was full of joy and
attention.	203.63699340820312
"that is to say, you had given your permission.	1468.21875
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	185.04042053222656
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all.	73.75306701660156
no, no,
you shall not deceive me.	5993.294921875
i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."	413.54486083984375
had lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	204.96304321289062
after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."	126.59156036376953
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	10727.708984375
"an easy distance do you call it?	618.028564453125
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	1049.4393310546875
bingley
was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	1093.3822021484375
no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy.	143.1634979248047
mr collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	381.7131042480469
as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	1005.7030639648438
you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	735.3165893554688
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	966.4241333007812
but so they always are.	284.2966613769531
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	534.6732788085938
i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	263.7301330566406
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"oh, papa, what news?	310.29931640625
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible
that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	221.46652221679688
elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	27.04831314086914
"oh!	130.83595275878906
he really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	196.4133758544922
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	4943.5751953125
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	715.8851318359375
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	212.2656707763672
he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	321.2821960449219
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	285.48419189453125
why was he to be the judge?"	58.34651184082031
you are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	558.165283203125
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	325.0433044433594
"_mr darcy_, you see, is the man!	580.0093994140625
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	615.8974609375
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	1242.537841796875
she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	575.6502075195312
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	241.23788452148438
it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."	234.39840698242188
from something that he told me in
our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him.	1468.2811279296875
this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself."	829.1821899414062
"you shall have it in few words.	1231.790771484375
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	2187.480224609375
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	2.9032318592071533
oh!	80.06751251220703
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	392.3065185546875
he readily agreed to it.	492.3062744140625
i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."	407.45538330078125
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at pemberley.	200.10101318359375
but that
gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."	438.7503356933594
i saw them the night before last."	405.33795166015625
if _i_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."	68.33392333984375
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	1318.929931640625
replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	109.19832611083984
my
father, however, is partial to mr wickham.	5380.0771484375
but you know married women have never much time for
writing.	465.062744140625
i cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.	941.1199951171875
it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner.	451.0548400878906
the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	270.75152587890625
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	63.4440803527832
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	301.50439453125
have all her friends left her?"	1538.6075439453125
he immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	139.72787475585938
i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	646.8944702148438
it must be an amusing study."	160.6882781982422
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	1034.5657958984375
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	1833.028564453125
elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	132.33477783203125
*       *       *       *       *

mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	103.87541961669922
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	259.7435607910156
it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	4537.7001953125
miss lucas is married and settled.	528.7508544921875
a lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	476.2628173828125
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	373.8161926269531
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	376.27874755859375
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	60.16347122192383
he did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september, than any body else in the country.	9548.23046875
that tall, proud man."	49.273929595947266
as long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	328.63433837890625
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	143.83242797851562
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	705.3555908203125
if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	1084.0435791015625
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr
bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	64.5675277709961
"no, i believe not."	448.9862060546875
"my object _then_," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	168.379150390625
it was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.	1503.9241943359375
how strange must it appear to him!	1720.5625
he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	115.5884780883789
could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life
     saw him so affected.	5506.49609375
we _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	34.07062530517578
repeated mr bennet.	54.86617660522461
mr bennet replied that he had not.	58.7329216003418
what is your own opinion?"	230.36572265625
"no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."	73.587158203125
i would go and see her, if i could have the
carriage."	3702.6162109375
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	222.65211486816406
i
never was.	249.23870849609375
in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	139.61245727539062
he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, i am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	298.2864685058594
"if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	563.4952392578125
"i do not get on at all.	138.35733032226562
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr
bingley, if she could.	20.51169776916504
"your humility, mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	168.94808959960938
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	106.15570068359375
we
shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some
balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all."	183.35791015625
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought
only of _you_."	1006.6285400390625
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	955.9738159179688
mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	319.5895080566406
he called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.	214.10081481933594
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning.	1963.4677734375
bingley urged mr jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	295.5770568847656
charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	394.2017822265625
lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	455.12542724609375
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	398.8052978515625
find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.'	1477.8372802734375
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	720.397705078125
the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	151.06845092773438
"for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her.	944.1278686523438
_she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	182.2317657470703
in every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	601.7630004882812
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	218.52261352539062
will you come and see me?"	139.00086975097656
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at!"	315.33648681640625
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards mr wickham.	5002.53564453125
the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	287.9210510253906
she was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr darcy said very
little, and mr hurst nothing at all.	464.5018005371094
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	1132.0997314453125
never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	1015.868896484375
but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	1704.3717041015625
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	149.80108642578125
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	847.3466186523438
had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	275.16778564453125
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	8.346001625061035
why did she come?	141.020263671875
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr
darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	1130.4361572265625
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	1603.4063720703125
i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	533.9234008789062
i declare i do not
know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."	102.57949829101562
and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment.	115.8676986694336
i will go directly to mr bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	265.98626708984375
she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	707.7442626953125
and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	645.024169921875
about ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire, to which he belonged.	44.6281852722168
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	9007.3388671875
he knows where we live.	773.0604858398438
one seems so forlorn without them."	227.42918395996094
the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	159.5402374267578
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	283.6960754394531
it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	7945.68896484375
had colonel forster seen denny himself?"	25.09171485900879
it cannot be.	27.04831314086914
"oh!	540.9896850585938
"it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	191.16612243652344
"ten thousand pounds!	77.35601043701172
"i think she will.	139.88267517089844
that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr darcy!	463.1091613769531
in
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	1427.2896728515625
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	4179.30078125
"and men take care that they should."	2764.15966796875
she declared her resolution.	91.83843994140625
"true.	201.90493774414062
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or
rather taller."	78.81208801269531
"mr bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	619.1689453125
"what should not you mind?"	768.2882690429688
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	15.774657249450684
"i cannot believe it.	266.0111083984375
he did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.	220.04808044433594
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure
you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."	375.2393798828125
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	595.7630004882812
i
     must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.	896.6910400390625
"she did indeed, louisa.	188.80369567871094
a
little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	581.2755126953125
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet.	86.2821273803711
"i cannot make him
out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	1414.8143310546875
thoughtless and indiscreet i
     can easily believe him, but this step and let us rejoice over it
     marks nothing bad at heart.	356.4874267578125
he was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"just as you please."	427.85443115234375
she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	944.3530883789062
what a stroke was this for poor jane!	358.306640625

oh, lizzy!	142.0348358154297
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	116.30372619628906
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	226.1201171875
to these high
flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	202.15771484375
had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	447.9101867675781
i only hope they may have half my
good luck.	103.92243957519531
"you cannot be too much on your guard.	1062.733642578125
in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	2.9032318592071533
oh!	1526.7474365234375
into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	285.3658142089844
and
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	57.066951751708984
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_."	472.5693359375
he came to tell mr gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia
     once.	967.9631958007812
and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	269.9072265625
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	1589.433349609375
her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	1663.1832275390625
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	276.4134216308594
they will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from
     mrs gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the south.	205.8555450439453
"and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."	754.7363891601562
i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	351.09765625
however, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	6536.64404296875
royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax
     returns.	209.2742462158203
"you have.	845.9727172851562
we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."	175.30316162109375
"yours, &c."

"well, my dear," said mr bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr bingley, and under your orders."	757.5530395507812
every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	532.2259521484375
he never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr
and mrs collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	568.84228515625
lydia laughed, and said,

"aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	124.8251953125
i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	190.57516479492188
"i certainly shall not.	424.295166015625
you need not send them word at
     longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
     wickham.	355.1695861816406
had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"	60.7807502746582
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."	578.7084350585938
a carat character is used to denote superscription.	1656.2220458984375
his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	58.96816635131836
they must all go to brighton.	244.1273956298828
"how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say.--_you_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	22.54669952392578
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	895.1275024414062
he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	343.5478515625
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	287.1867980957031
"with my mother up stairs.	411.23626708984375
he has
     more to give.	1061.536376953125
she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	321.30609130859375
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	321.5654296875
this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	192.51309204101562
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	1228.286865234375
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	526.96630859375
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	270.2867736816406
who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	1.3444759845733643
thank heaven!	155.69898986816406
"bingley."	2162.961181640625
he did trace them easily to
     clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from epsom.	1441.3934326171875
the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	944.37060546875
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	54.115997314453125
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."	153.97471618652344
"no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension.	2098.505126953125
i will only add, god bless you.	760.3041381835938
from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	194.514892578125
they were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	717.4088745117188
"only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away;
it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	598.0787963867188
he heard her with astonishment.	646.8158569335938
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss
bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	281.0043029785156
but let me advise you to think better of it.	256.260498046875
"impossible, mr bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	285.4599914550781
they met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed.	114.12922668457031
he was well, but so much
engaged with mr darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	198.78652954101562
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	30.827987670898438
"upon my word," said mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	129.8094940185547
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	214.34075927734375
she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley.	3366.53466796875
well, much good may it do them!	589.751708984375
her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	752.1381225585938
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	1114.6444091796875
they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	2522.317626953125
i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	879.5169067382812
elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	3136.98291015625
if mr darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	73.70867156982422
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr
wickham and herself.	373.2159423828125
i dearly love a
laugh."	20.533315658569336
mr darcy bowed.	45.48115539550781
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	975.4332275390625
if he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	29.6357364654541
gardiner."	2045.078125
a clear ten
thousand per annum.	175.5030517578125
whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr bennet were dead.	13014.3056640625
only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"	972.2597045898438
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	36.7669563293457
"it is a long time, mr bingley, since you went away," said mrs bennet.	1167.97802734375
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	168.2265167236328
it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	141.64566040039062
"no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose.	1450.63671875
is not he a charming man?	19.566381454467773
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	116.14405822753906
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	7742.8857421875
donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	2.9032318592071533
oh!	346.5287170410156
"yes--the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	571.1832275390625
my
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of mr wickham.	5500.28662109375
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	595.3291015625
in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	1858.6754150390625
mr
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn
family; jane heard them with horror.	958.01953125
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	666.1595458984375
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	449.1551818847656
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."	111.85098266601562
"i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	278.9674072265625
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	490.8934326171875
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	1352.9730224609375
he could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	666.0267944335938
their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	510.2294006347656
"he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling.	243.65420532226562
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	439.76220703125
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	1306.2906494140625
"i had much rather go in the coach."	3088.1630859375
as she pronounced these words, mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	345.6995544433594
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!	79.18698120117188
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	361.7483215332031
i was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth
     and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	339.10528564453125
"how could
you begin?"	624.3715209960938
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	208.58999633789062
she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings.	485.77276611328125
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	283.1346740722656
she could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	158.6297149658203
i appeal to mr darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	255.0028076171875
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	224.67098999023438
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	3138.88037109375
my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	437.703857421875
"you can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	715.444580078125
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	1175.6295166015625
such a countenance, such manners!	419.1196594238281
for what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"	436.58612060546875
lord bless me!	273.95050048828125
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	279.3616943359375
but though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	272.9981689453125
can it be really so!	533.578857421875
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	191.9234619140625
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	1553.1680908203125
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	916.0756225585938
at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	258.4343566894531
"i am sure there is not on _his_.	229.714599609375
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	1385.1971435546875
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.	263.2107849121094
in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to mrs collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	471.42962646484375
"you are quite right.	572.4462280273438
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	295.20928955078125
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	1913.91064453125
it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	337.9640197753906
she answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"my eldest sister has been in town these three months.	417.5306701660156
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	463.7161865234375
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
pemberley.	716.3792724609375
sir william only smiled.	2916.1533203125
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	426.1126403808594
if you
do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the
rules is very easy.	984.2482299804688
"i have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	275.7673034667969
my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says.	1048.8328857421875
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!	4841.39306640625
"she is my youngest girl but one.	35.75718307495117
i am ashamed of you!	297.11761474609375
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	268.2049865722656
she cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving wickham.	349.38134765625
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	1419.6414794921875
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.	772.3448486328125
in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	736.7025146484375
elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	613.9706420898438
"when i consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew
what he was.	750.3569946289062
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	3058.3359375
you give me
fresh life and vigour.	813.1373291015625
elizabeth was forced to go.	218.55979919433594
she tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr
darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	912.9580688476562
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"	119.57743835449219
"by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.	44.583187103271484
at present i will
say nothing about it."	1571.1690673828125
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	317.8192443847656
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	1559.9036865234375
he resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.	412.53033447265625
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	527.1331787109375
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	470.8971252441406
elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	1118.6649169921875
"fitzwilliam darcy."	854.4689331054688
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	81.39613342285156
if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	84.52816009521484
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	715.1307983398438
i dare say mr bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	432.5412902832031
she asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then
observed,

"your father's estate is entailed on mr collins, i think.	320.36614990234375
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	74.08206176757812
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."	44.41267776489258
"i should not mind any thing at all."	239.04734802246094
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	2038.32275390625
but, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	955.6375122070312
"yours, &c."

as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	554.0209350585938
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out.	4615.2021484375
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	254.49127197265625
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by wickham.	1339.9063720703125
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	16313.48046875
come be quick, be quick!	969.8417358398438
"dear madam," cried mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from mr gardiner?	145.28416442871094
i congratulate her.	644.8172607421875
the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	11459.0126953125
"and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	598.6548461914062
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	194.7070770263672
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	1255.194091796875
she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	178.64651489257812
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	1223.45849609375
she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but mrs bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	1657.3919677734375
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.	155.6875457763672
but i hope you will not mind it: it is
all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	5.684544086456299
good bye."	192.1326141357422
"upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except netherfield.	661.1517333984375
she
could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	269.16278076171875
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	481.146728515625
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.	1538.734375
i dare say the
lace upon mrs hurst's gown----"

here she was interrupted again.	212.8467254638672
he owns it
himself without disguise."	363.328857421875
