16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom’s present
age bloom would be 54. in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen
would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of

immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter
from the usual boy jones, who happened to come across them at the
crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,
drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a
domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord
and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would
overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes
though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as
quite possibly there were several others.	99.99771118164062

the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched, inflicted
fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was

appearance of a star 1st magnitude of exceeding brilliancy dominating
by night and day a new luminous sun generated by the collision and
amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns about the
period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent

family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by
the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings
they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy, boody and
katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes,
pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning

the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born 1820, acceded
1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke
and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru
imaginary: thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand
lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street:
fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverist’s
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverist’s revelations of white
articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
while she nelly bouverist was in the articles: fifthly, the
difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
allusions from _everybody’s book of jokes_ 1000 pages and a laugh in
every one: sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,
associated with the names of the new lord mayor, daniel tallon, the new

sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about
saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging
around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the
sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	118.15434265136719

between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and
the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously
inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the
variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by
inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite
proposition parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic
transitive verb with direct feminine object from the active voice into
its correlative aorist preterite proposition parsed as feminine
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past
participle with complementary masculine agent in the passive voice:

production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest

j. j. o’molloy resumed, moulding his words:

mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the

felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly

for instance when the
evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely
in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	53.7902717590332

lady dudley was walking home
through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that
cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of dublin.	31.68926239013672
he closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new

the milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop
the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off

still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, i’m a stickler for solid

mr bloom walked towards dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
smooth.	61.15977096557617
i was with bob doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do

resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in
preparation for the impact of the fall.	47.22236251831055

he fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into

his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:

a large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from

stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	93.31258392333984
influential friends.	19.626848220825195
in vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through trinity gates.	76.76287841796875
does
anybody really?	38.09418487548828
that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as plato’s.	307.28192138671875
holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is
landed.	105.00794219970703
he provokes my intelligence.	61.011680603027344
he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	34.57341384887695
stephen: panting.	186.14337158203125

a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	151.77345275878906

black church.	41.91670227050781
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	190.53700256347656
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	49.442684173583984
short but to the point


whose land?	59.32173538208008

let us go round by the chief’s grave, hynes said.	166.8196563720703
is it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been
prince hamlet’s twin, is it possible, i want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?	244.44586181640625
certainly, i
sort of believe strong in you, mr president.	17.403905868530273

he closed my carriage door outside sir thornley stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	28.306114196777344
why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s
daughter?	417.2693786621094

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._

so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard
