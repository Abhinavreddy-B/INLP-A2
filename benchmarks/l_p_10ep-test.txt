156.87020874023438
she was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	129.11056518554688
my situation in life, my connections
with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	218.14915466308594
"my dear friend,

     "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.	201.82493591308594
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	68.78897094726562
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	216.51364135742188
are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"	106.04136657714844
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	118.1766586303711
their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	101.83252716064453
but they did pass away, and mr and
mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn.	141.67343139648438
"i hope, my dear," said mr bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	95.43537139892578
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	126.3209228515625
she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley's inattention.	88.95333862304688
"what is it you mean?"	26.146242141723633
"oh!	3.4261279106140137
i grieve to
     find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared w. was not a man to be trusted.	206.21963500976562
one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	147.1358642578125
he generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	497.1398010253906
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	299.5650329589844
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	116.39920806884766
mr gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	155.24407958984375
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."	303.0954895019531
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."	175.618408203125
"sometimes.	315.5028076171875
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same;
and mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss
bennet.	162.49111938476562
this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	154.41993713378906
he spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided.	139.074462890625
she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	244.33071899414062
colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	31.037670135498047
"but why all this secrecy?	168.16380310058594
"thank you--but i always mend my own."	84.86190795898438
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."	116.94217681884766
"it is well.	15.867003440856934
how mr darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	30.21471405029297
and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,

"dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr collins must excuse
me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	123.15446472167969
1.f.4.	2.4658005237579346
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy,
were to entertain each other.	140.98731994628906
she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will
be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my
good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage
every thing.	100.32745361328125
no, no, this is not likely.	44.17927932739258
her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	164.16336059570312
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	92.04988861083984
ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!	127.6688232421875
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	142.6634979248047
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	272.7738342285156
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	62.88261032104492
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	227.5581512451172
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	110.91531372070312
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	57.98644256591797
i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	72.84795379638672
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	626.5921020507812
_you_
may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer."	175.1971893310547
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	80.51004791259766
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	89.9759750366211
elizabeth smiled.	25.37941551208496
they have at
least that advantage."	106.73224639892578
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	166.10179138183594
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	130.9246826171875
must it be so?"	42.33933639526367
"sure he
will not leave london before he has found them.	244.83853149414062
why does she not come in?"	96.68330383300781
everything wore
a happier aspect.	56.08186721801758
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."	213.2876739501953
but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable.	237.9164581298828
the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	169.26385498046875
he observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it
is above eight months.	178.31884765625
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	166.82847595214844
but your
_family_ owe me nothing.	255.4080352783203
u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.	452.40283203125
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	122.70609283447266
"i am trying to make it out."	52.89259719848633
i do not wish to avoid the walk.	43.194419860839844
nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the united states.	183.75677490234375
i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	72.59149169921875
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	210.26510620117188
how can mr bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	211.58041381835938
with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."	160.36695861816406
well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man mr stone.	127.3437271118164
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	166.88394165039062
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	139.92190551757812
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	156.8748779296875
i will
think no more about him."	38.71953201293945
"i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	325.5030212402344
let wickham
be _your_ man.	302.8872985839844
i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	431.77783203125
after making
     every possible enquiry on that side london, colonel f. came on into
     hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.	184.28773498535156
"yes, ma'am, all."	26.29841423034668
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects.	267.64642333984375
do not distress me by the idea.	77.94041442871094
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	260.9577941894531
let me hear what it is."	43.066253662109375
it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	109.35209655761719
we want none of them;
do we?"	195.75167846679688
"where is your sister?"	49.54792785644531
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	226.57049560546875
cried his wife impatiently.	110.88406372070312
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	1312.0093994140625
whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."	29.726991653442383
but he found lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	473.87451171875
her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	241.3438720703125
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	70.26792907714844
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and mr collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	139.7937774658203
mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	245.2472381591797
adieu to disappointment and spleen.	112.83843231201172

updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

after
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	193.31478881835938
he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	146.45855712890625
"if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes."	139.83518981933594
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	156.43780517578125
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."	78.39690399169922
it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	116.0007095336914
they then went away.	121.17536926269531
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	107.47066497802734
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	124.10403442382812
the one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	255.88296508789062
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	123.2160873413086
an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	30.69300651550293
_you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	190.8048553466797
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come."	151.03662109375
do not repeat what i then said.	199.03456115722656
this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	261.7716064453125
a low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	113.1579360961914
i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."	108.29627227783203
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said,

"i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	209.63980102539062
i do not trust my own
partiality.	50.13026428222656
"you must not blame my aunt.	37.835121154785156
and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose?	138.0461883544922
"not at all."	16.57550048828125
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	186.94081115722656
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"well, jane, who is it from?	98.6829605102539
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	169.2600555419922
"are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"	141.74720764160156
you do not look
well.	33.01268005371094
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	98.60708618164062
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	252.2651824951172
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	311.57513427734375
"and have you heard from him often?"	77.65499114990234
after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer.	162.46533203125
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the
head quarters.	168.04612731933594
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	108.89783477783203
with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	205.32626342773438
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends.	204.6863555908203
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	119.371826171875
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!	127.20614624023438
lady catherine, sir william, and mr and mrs collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her
party.	106.20563507080078
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt
that i _should_ be looked at.	95.30593872070312
mrs bennet said only, "nonsense,
nonsense!"	108.79164123535156
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	141.89605712890625
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"	125.73440551757812
if you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."	67.986572265625
and so would anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	379.26068115234375
wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	134.5428924560547
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	90.80779266357422
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour, till sir william thus began.	209.72059631347656
about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	249.49923706054688
"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	226.73118591308594
lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	155.77621459960938
but i knew i should
persuade you at last.	63.71800231933594
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	78.66043853759766
you blamed me for coming?"	60.80361557006836
i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better."	89.74960327148438
my dear jane, mr collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	75.68103790283203
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."	137.98626708984375
you promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	76.74665832519531
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	137.7184600830078
very odd!--and you only the
second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your
younger sisters must be very young?"	165.5060577392578
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty.	60.085289001464844
five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs
bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	135.02891540527344
if
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	96.76534271240234
there was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	224.17059326171875
give me farther particulars.	532.015625
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	170.37759399414062
mr darcy!	8.154088973999023
let me do it without farther loss of time.	263.0039978027344
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	72.0997085571289
_hunsford, near westerham, kent,

     15th october._

     dear sir,

     the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the
     misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"there, mrs bennet."	210.8756866455078

is it true?"	48.15177917480469
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."	150.60159301757812
"your first position is false.	97.49565124511719
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	260.9420166015625
colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	204.23593139648438
"and is this all?"	39.41584777832031
all that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the london road.	172.85142517089844
when my niece georgiana went to
ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady
anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i
am excessively attentive to all those things.	220.9986572265625
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	134.33456420898438
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	76.79348754882812
mr gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	239.7523956298828
his countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	187.82688903808594
but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	391.8531494140625
every thing being settled between _them_, mr darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	223.96897888183594
it was agreed to.	84.25174713134766
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth,

"i am glad you are come back, lizzy."	202.58453369140625
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	106.7176513671875
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	343.31695556640625
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	403.4697265625
"lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say.	36.37753677368164
1813.




pride & prejudice.	1189.8533935546875
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	252.88424682617188
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	74.5142822265625
lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	209.33811950683594
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr darcy," she cried; "i
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	211.56800842285156
he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	123.20233917236328
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."	249.73550415039062
it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	240.6567840576172
but, lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or jane at most.	142.72720336914062
she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	208.89816284179688
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	108.10511016845703
"so much the better.	29.516443252563477
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	377.9972229003906
"of what are you talking?"	58.33168411254883
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	219.73812866210938
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her."	54.819969177246094
perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.	109.35767364501953
she was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr
wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	129.1226348876953
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what
say you to the day?	65.70252227783203
"that is very strange.	26.57124137878418
if elizabeth, when mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	102.24537658691406
the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	496.8054504394531
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	180.6610870361328
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	226.45977783203125
"but to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	264.4743957519531
--and
upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
mr collins."	205.2371826171875
"can you deny that you have done it?"	59.07227325439453
"after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	179.7686004638672
"i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	121.34078979492188
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.	74.45976257324219
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.	251.38427734375
"you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	96.36994171142578
they will have nothing else to
do."	33.273685455322266
"this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	266.46990966796875
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	55.21971893310547
it was to this effect:

     "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.	341.6244812011719
"one of them does."	74.34439086914062
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	345.3076477050781
i will try again.	78.96929168701172
but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	162.2415008544922
when mr collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	215.4989013671875
he was on one side of her mother.	46.520668029785156
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	216.7422332763672
sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	348.3540954589844
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	29.417461395263672
she got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	175.93833923339844
"if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as
you.	59.69308853149414
a lively imagination soon settled it all.	193.0518035888672
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	122.42107391357422
by many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	184.41397094726562
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	135.2542724609375
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr
bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	159.91549682617188
but it is all, all too late now."	74.20487976074219
good heaven!	29.98841667175293
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs gardiner, "i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	88.81855773925781
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my
cards."	132.03079223632812
but
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	116.41268920898438
"dear sir,

     "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	209.35211181640625
"do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	93.79083251953125
he expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	164.6593017578125
such a charming man!--so handsome!	88.8605728149414
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr darcy!"	75.82837677001953
but i confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	52.518375396728516
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project
gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	305.7316589355469
she is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--your's, &c.

     "e.	196.18740844726562
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	311.9820556640625
she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	104.05731201171875
"i mention it, because it is the living which i ought to have had.	262.06201171875
"dearest jane!	209.68309020996094
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	150.66632080078125
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable
house.	506.92352294921875
the path just admitted three.	128.46641540527344
to mrs gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	110.85772705078125
you both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	298.7232971191406
though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	114.8239974975586
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	230.021728515625
my object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise."	52.58146286010742
"yes, almost every day."	96.84779357910156
such a disappointment!	150.91395568847656
i send no compliments to your
mother.	108.33386993408203
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	196.05796813964844
not handsome enough to dance with!	45.161407470703125
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know."	65.29924011230469
"my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you.	280.4681701660156
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do."	44.1204948425293
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	189.83880615234375
elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley.	105.4028091430664
"i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	245.539794921875
_their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	48.57112121582031
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	91.83256530761719
elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name.	239.56312561035156
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	238.0694122314453
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	110.81117248535156
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	82.46158599853516
i wonder what he can be doing there."	206.23704528808594
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough.	67.88771057128906
"and do you really know all this?"	185.08323669433594
it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	35.675819396972656
we do not suffer by _accident_.	163.209716796875
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	29.063520431518555
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	3.4261279106140137
"oh!	249.1925048828125
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	212.37094116210938
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	259.0975646972656
in
understanding darcy was the superior.	275.6497497558594
but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	160.23171997070312
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more
than i ever look into."	118.93927764892578
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	194.69288635253906
"why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	102.47380828857422
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr
bennet coolly observed,

"from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	188.58389282226562
we will go round the park every day.	122.38063049316406
you had much better
dance."	1033.218017578125
why must their
marriage be private?	214.71966552734375
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	109.42047882080078
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	95.76471710205078
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	152.37364196777344
for your
sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss
bennet?"	92.11421966552734
"not so hasty, if you please.	107.63606262207031
you will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	27.259923934936523
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	213.6262969970703
many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	173.0203094482422
they were all astonished; and mr bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."	94.04448699951172
you have done all this!	112.16667938232422
after a short pause,
her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	77.54620361328125
it was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	278.5938720703125
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley."	95.0385513305664
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."	13.625460624694824
darcy made no answer.	159.56838989257812
he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	141.31495666503906
from
what can it proceed?	401.6613464355469
for
my part, mr bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	388.0276794433594
compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	273.2063903808594
"undoubtedly.	182.76487731933594
he
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	75.98119354248047
it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	39.79400634765625
_i_ did for you.	283.06634521484375
there are a lot of things you can do with project
gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic
works.	104.63567352294922
"if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.	305.8292236328125
lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	190.21121215820312
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	119.90054321289062
"you need not distress yourself.	282.15496826171875
the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	181.41505432128906
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.	116.32968139648438
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	305.7646179199219
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	35.747989654541016
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to
say.	253.92361450195312
she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	98.49213409423828
"she
looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	60.026817321777344
she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	96.24695587158203
these
were the contents:

     "my dear harriet,

     "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
     missed.	129.937744140625
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."	20.524639129638672
i did not wink at you."	92.31151580810547
what will wickham say?	249.34664916992188
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "ah!	53.615989685058594
"perhaps we might be deceived."	147.39491271972656
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	109.22337341308594
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	306.97845458984375
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	121.23941802978516
"but consider your daughters.	297.2799987792969
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	21.6412296295166
we must not make him desperate."	71.04254150390625
but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	90.26337432861328
you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	149.77073669433594
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	135.33253479003906
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,"
said she, "though i am _not_ her particular friend.	99.06507873535156
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	97.1338882446289
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."	145.92054748535156
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	38.381019592285156
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	41.98097229003906
"but what is to be
done about pemberley?"	44.35078811645508
"no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."	118.13072967529297
but his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	29.535606384277344
end of the second volume.	280.8755798339844
mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	54.66986846923828
very
nonsensical to come at all!	240.94876098632812
i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."	135.87619018554688
lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and mr collins, in describing the civility of mr and
mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	112.7401123046875
nobody wants him to come.	115.0528793334961
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	100.71883392333984
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	138.761474609375
any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.	81.77102661132812
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."	23.892244338989258
"oh, lord!	173.6320037841797
but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr darcy walk into the
room.	52.66798782348633
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	35.03383255004883
the
other is miss de bourgh.	134.43508911132812
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	121.2863540649414
as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	14.398488998413086
cried bingley.	224.7599334716797
never, even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at
rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings.	106.4975357055664
mr collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	46.739994049072266
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	162.56692504882812
have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	49.33742141723633
they must have seen them together for ever."	26.974882125854492
how well
it sounds.	177.280029296875
elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	29.8491268157959
this is your final resolve!	62.388851165771484
but do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	127.35660552978516
he could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	158.98130798339844
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	142.26393127441406
can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?"	45.79433822631836
the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	183.56491088867188
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	132.72476196289062
let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."	499.9042053222656
this idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	65.38227081298828
if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them."	130.85324096679688
jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	202.2395782470703
but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	167.6999969482422
there
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom mr darcy could have
such boundless influence.	80.93480682373047
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	184.3701934814453
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	127.99517059326172
to mr bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	178.27957153320312
for such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	112.32178497314453
on distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	90.32830047607422
cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and mr darcy appeared.	28.654756546020508
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	72.95832061767578
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and
i hope you will consent to be of the party.	203.5629425048828
his behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	135.29342651367188
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	115.4068374633789
but now it was all too natural.	210.32345581054688
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	41.67524337768555
elizabeth now began to revive.	27.413881301879883
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	121.37846374511719
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	191.355712890625
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	139.78477478027344
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	165.40863037109375
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	137.6146697998047
do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	131.89230346679688
kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	129.7458038330078
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	34.39219284057617
if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	112.68964385986328
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	204.04873657226562
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	206.8926544189453
my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	3.4261279106140137
"oh!	178.70062255859375
i am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	79.83610534667969
i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	174.7382354736328
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."	194.34866333007812
as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	91.02281951904297
see
paragraph 1.c below.	54.01191329956055
"yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	28.307727813720703
my dear," continued mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	12.478283882141113
"yes.	141.3927459716797
he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	181.43624877929688
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."	134.89666748046875
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either.	107.437255859375
on the following monday, mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at
longbourn.	38.88115310668945
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	151.78836059570312
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.	17.069433212280273
"yes, very well.	113.50839233398438
i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	88.18521118164062
"i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would
not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	228.4253692626953
"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	234.82228088378906
lady lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty.	57.547645568847656
but what does he say of the living?"	61.9640007019043
we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	64.19025421142578
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."	18.031084060668945
i am not romantic you know.	123.4233627319336
she
certainly did not hate him.	32.751853942871094
he was
angry.	141.968017578125
her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	197.45883178710938
it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you.	318.99652099609375
my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	107.0427017211914
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of mr darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.	179.81591796875
"they
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr bingley and his sisters."	180.8189697265625
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	137.84178161621094
she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	420.696044921875
where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	77.28193664550781

pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."	62.961307525634766
she felt that she had no business at
pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	190.29330444335938
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	45.95537185668945
i don't know.	182.15635681152344
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!	139.0651092529297
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	32.50566864013672
"that it ought not to be attempted.	545.8009033203125
she stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	113.31230926513672
"let her be called down.	209.32565307617188

"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is
about."	78.95219421386719
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	95.83036804199219
but here he was set right by mrs bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	57.5098991394043
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	75.8081283569336
do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"	473.1871643066406
she knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	213.3491973876953

she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	30.670188903808594
wickham is safe."	124.45065307617188
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"oh!	73.45561981201172
jane, i take your place now, and you must go
lower, because i am a married woman."	81.99972534179688

miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	54.89896774291992
"it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	89.9195327758789
we had better not mention it.	264.7601013183594
"lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	146.99630737304688
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, i am determined.	56.78628158569336
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	175.664794921875
catherine and lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	95.76856231689453
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	49.83945846557617
"'tis too much!"	94.615234375
since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	50.1634407043457
have not you always hated him?"	157.2747802734375
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	108.62276458740234
in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	154.09092712402344
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucas's last week; and even mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least.	102.9676742553711

him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	414.7488708496094

was returned in due form.	75.30087280273438
let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	30.50408935546875
but she would not be secure.	184.11436462402344
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	103.70051574707031
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
what to think."	161.45973205566406
mrs bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	67.69608306884766
well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	141.3953094482422
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	144.32489013671875
you must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     project gutenberg-tm works.	130.20033264160156
mrs
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	296.8714599609375
your's, &c.

     "edw.	170.1953887939453
lady
catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.	88.0968246459961
lady catherine seemed resigned.	236.10133361816406
the miss
webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--do you draw?"	1111.9083251953125
"neglect!	192.1370849609375
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	148.92185974121094
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	175.290771484375
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"you, who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	61.24986267089844
we now come to the point.	141.18833923339844
i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance.	142.1917724609375
had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	65.12812042236328
you shall not defend her,
though it is charlotte lucas.	26.786521911621094
said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	28.733875274658203
mrs collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure."	58.760738372802734
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	117.67214965820312
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	238.64601135253906
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	169.1886444091797
his most particular
friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	151.96275329589844
she mentioned this to her friend miss
lucas.	74.03064727783203
there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."	83.87255096435547
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	108.1921615600586
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	423.25146484375
the person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.	145.58583068847656
thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	111.22737121582031
at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends."	129.06045532226562
he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	295.20477294921875
mrs hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	138.68804931640625
i never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	107.00723266601562
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild."	55.44475173950195
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	77.22572326660156
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	75.9881820678711
it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	71.5660171508789
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to
think."	108.77857208251953
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	91.41349792480469
if this be the case, he deserves you.	150.86387634277344
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	170.04751586914062
her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	238.02366638183594
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	131.36976623535156
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	299.5079040527344
the younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's
dying an old maid.	75.11761474609375
she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	80.63945007324219
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	71.77530670166016
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	111.8936538696289
putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	383.9520568847656
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	85.27886199951172
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	200.5162353515625
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	84.73776245117188
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable.	156.34959411621094
he
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	53.65712356567383
there he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	245.15115356445312
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	124.17146301269531
but i can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."	258.3486022949219
but gracious me!	82.78717041015625
how can they suit each other?--do you
know mr bingley?"	88.22209930419922
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	168.04388427734375
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy
had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	63.60847473144531
"we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	170.6063690185547
she read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	103.7020492553711
that he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr gardiner.	113.07886505126953
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	67.45467376708984
it was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	51.288551330566406
i am the happiest creature in
     the world.	105.39315795898438
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."	228.41676330566406
"neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	131.18460083007812
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	212.12249755859375
your sister i also watched.--her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have
     been in an error.	33.37668991088867
single, my dear, to be sure!	92.91683959960938
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."	154.19309997558594
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	23.619173049926758
dear, dear lizzy.	72.15438842773438
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	123.14776611328125
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."	61.742000579833984
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	258.8652648925781
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	277.6251220703125
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.	144.66754150390625
he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."	93.1983413696289
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs
gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	222.58099365234375
i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	87.4278793334961
--said jane as she
finished it.	128.85643005371094
she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	295.3888244628906
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	315.14044189453125
not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr darcy
returned within the stated time.	170.3123779296875
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	3.4261279106140137
"oh!	177.33380126953125
you agree that the foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage.	154.15985107421875
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	136.6072998046875
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	159.323486328125
the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.	2.4658005237579346
1.e.9.	113.56925964355469
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs
philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	99.45082092285156
he was full of joy and
attention.	62.251739501953125
"that is to say, you had given your permission.	254.2301483154297
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	81.13886260986328
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all.	29.50336265563965
no, no,
you shall not deceive me.	316.9414367675781
i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."	168.53619384765625
had lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	115.6250228881836
after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."	56.940425872802734
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	324.8074951171875
"an easy distance do you call it?	160.07546997070312
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	136.59779357910156
bingley
was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	218.44395446777344
no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy.	100.67408752441406
mr collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	135.3336181640625
as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	162.53466796875
you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	191.38064575195312
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	162.3460693359375
but so they always are.	181.5567169189453
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	107.52239990234375
i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	120.52965545654297
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"oh, papa, what news?	148.27154541015625
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible
that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	86.3358383178711
elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	3.4261279106140137
"oh!	77.12979125976562
he really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	99.86386108398438
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	409.9823913574219
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	218.16329956054688
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	123.75314331054688
he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	159.57318115234375
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	73.73643493652344
why was he to be the judge?"	45.34968566894531
you are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	288.8514709472656
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	58.56951141357422
"_mr darcy_, you see, is the man!	183.3690185546875
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	206.9900360107422
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	255.45529174804688
she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	147.63406372070312
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	151.52447509765625
it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."	179.69505310058594
from something that he told me in
our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him.	100.65626525878906
this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself."	68.786865234375
"you shall have it in few words.	139.2173309326172
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	132.76541137695312
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	1.472418189048767
oh!	45.429893493652344
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	300.20379638671875
he readily agreed to it.	332.2196044921875
i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."	180.00448608398438
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at pemberley.	98.0334701538086
but that
gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."	157.7818603515625
i saw them the night before last."	165.8746337890625
if _i_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."	36.53187942504883
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	266.9757385253906
replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	38.154449462890625
my
father, however, is partial to mr wickham.	505.93609619140625
but you know married women have never much time for
writing.	156.91116333007812
i cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.	137.89849853515625
it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner.	158.7445831298828
the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	96.94121551513672
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	84.11641693115234
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	74.7685546875
have all her friends left her?"	363.3181457519531
he immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	161.8269805908203
i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	116.08325958251953
it must be an amusing study."	99.34119415283203
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	293.4185485839844
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	233.43936157226562
elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	204.30995178222656
*       *       *       *       *

mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	52.0338249206543
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	88.96012878417969
it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	108.99851989746094
miss lucas is married and settled.	135.6296844482422
a lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	116.74356842041016
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	112.83304595947266
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	188.2682342529297
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	67.91130828857422
he did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september, than any body else in the country.	410.4906005859375
that tall, proud man."	58.45522689819336
as long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	178.61883544921875
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	94.91514587402344
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	244.4097442626953
if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	237.0843963623047
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr
bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	21.527925491333008
"no, i believe not."	140.56341552734375
"my object _then_," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	95.54464721679688
it was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.	204.1612548828125
how strange must it appear to him!	149.68313598632812
he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	72.33110809326172
could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life
     saw him so affected.	273.5088195800781
we _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	12.653275489807129
repeated mr bennet.	26.556123733520508
mr bennet replied that he had not.	21.94637680053711
what is your own opinion?"	94.097900390625
"no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."	56.3109245300293
i would go and see her, if i could have the
carriage."	287.97296142578125
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	69.07881164550781
i
never was.	115.02946472167969
in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	113.59947204589844
he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, i am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	97.03546142578125
"if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	29.802515029907227
"i do not get on at all.	62.907142639160156
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr
bingley, if she could.	18.918874740600586
"your humility, mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	101.8579330444336
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	70.984375
we
shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some
balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all."	92.77198028564453
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought
only of _you_."	297.3089294433594
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	139.1949462890625
mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	170.26634216308594
he called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.	124.32710266113281
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning.	412.5580749511719
bingley urged mr jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	171.5723114013672
charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	152.0682830810547
lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	142.472900390625
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	98.33906555175781
find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.'	184.8163604736328
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	135.54867553710938
the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	72.67693328857422
"for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her.	209.13108825683594
_she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	176.61390686035156
in every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	291.8917236328125
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	67.21835327148438
will you come and see me?"	62.16331100463867
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at!"	87.49185180664062
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards mr wickham.	366.1622619628906
the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	97.50630187988281
she was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr darcy said very
little, and mr hurst nothing at all.	171.0475311279297
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	259.81439208984375
never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	99.15473175048828
but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	527.5435180664062
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	46.32115173339844
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	202.934326171875
had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	69.25804138183594
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	64.36253356933594
why did she come?	144.05702209472656
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr
darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	237.44882202148438
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	224.50906372070312
i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	182.94178771972656
i declare i do not
know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."	98.65138244628906
and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment.	79.86682891845703
i will go directly to mr bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	116.7113265991211
she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	260.6185607910156
and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	173.69715881347656
about ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire, to which he belonged.	52.693321228027344
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	334.5401916503906
he knows where we live.	65.5937728881836
one seems so forlorn without them."	127.98699188232422
the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	95.46918487548828
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	80.84654998779297
it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	237.56524658203125
had colonel forster seen denny himself?"	14.70097541809082
it cannot be.	3.4261279106140137
"oh!	79.46803283691406
"it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	231.5048065185547
"ten thousand pounds!	33.78089904785156
"i think she will.	103.5489730834961
that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr darcy!	256.1170959472656
in
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	268.7019348144531
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	195.99459838867188
"and men take care that they should."	242.4681854248047
she declared her resolution.	53.92697525024414
"true.	91.66234588623047
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or
rather taller."	59.156410217285156
"mr bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	72.59564208984375
"what should not you mind?"	193.2196807861328
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	11.415949821472168
"i cannot believe it.	96.5890121459961
he did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.	97.0633773803711
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure
you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."	171.23997497558594
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	234.7726593017578
i
     must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.	116.40464782714844
"she did indeed, louisa.	71.4288330078125
a
little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	179.8385467529297
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet.	79.96621704101562
"i cannot make him
out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	356.7314147949219
thoughtless and indiscreet i
     can easily believe him, but this step and let us rejoice over it
     marks nothing bad at heart.	118.1734390258789
he was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"just as you please."	152.1318817138672
she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	219.5079345703125
what a stroke was this for poor jane!	181.3093719482422

oh, lizzy!	79.96621704101562
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	51.78456115722656
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	125.83348846435547
to these high
flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	137.81350708007812
had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	248.09756469726562
i only hope they may have half my
good luck.	39.097293853759766
"you cannot be too much on your guard.	409.0782775878906
in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	1.472418189048767
oh!	179.45590209960938
into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	126.9105453491211
and
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	46.162235260009766
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_."	166.44778442382812
he came to tell mr gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia
     once.	174.9825439453125
and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	159.40716552734375
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	321.35357666015625
her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	172.36631774902344
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	115.6973876953125
they will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from
     mrs gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the south.	89.76736450195312
"and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."	156.24844360351562
i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	67.27144622802734
however, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	632.7830200195312
royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax
     returns.	26.791839599609375
"you have.	156.05783081054688
we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."	98.62232208251953
"yours, &c."

"well, my dear," said mr bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr bingley, and under your orders."	170.1527099609375
every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	236.03221130371094
he never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr
and mrs collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	162.90182495117188
lydia laughed, and said,

"aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	106.23770141601562
i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	65.08030700683594
"i certainly shall not.	141.0597381591797
you need not send them word at
     longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
     wickham.	164.6847381591797
had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"	45.32308578491211
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."	52.513187408447266
a carat character is used to denote superscription.	187.50430297851562
his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	55.92388153076172
they must all go to brighton.	118.66747283935547
"how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say.--_you_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	16.364511489868164
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	272.9803466796875
he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	86.47361755371094
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	182.33457946777344
"with my mother up stairs.	51.08515930175781
he has
     more to give.	210.8163604736328
she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	129.23214721679688
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	92.64929962158203
this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	128.85397338867188
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	146.67758178710938
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	263.8666076660156
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	71.51993560791016
who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	41.73584747314453
thank heaven!	37.42732238769531
"bingley."	386.630859375
he did trace them easily to
     clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from epsom.	387.5438232421875
the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	187.43655395507812
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	74.12319946289062
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."	41.646202087402344
"no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension.	249.32797241210938
i will only add, god bless you.	214.41293334960938
from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	140.55462646484375
they were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	177.52508544921875
"only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away;
it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	103.23127746582031
he heard her with astonishment.	194.21275329589844
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss
bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	133.95269775390625
but let me advise you to think better of it.	85.75555419921875
"impossible, mr bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	96.5248794555664
they met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed.	75.2011947631836
he was well, but so much
engaged with mr darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	60.02278518676758
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	39.63334274291992
"upon my word," said mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	108.40621948242188
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	194.37255859375
she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley.	309.3316955566406
well, much good may it do them!	173.8555908203125
her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	398.2815856933594
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	284.6300354003906
they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	365.282470703125
i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	303.6882019042969
elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	236.20008850097656
if mr darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	111.7531509399414
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr
wickham and herself.	164.4361572265625
i dearly love a
laugh."	15.424966812133789
mr darcy bowed.	24.447866439819336
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	311.9792175292969
if he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	10.720548629760742
gardiner."	214.0261688232422
a clear ten
thousand per annum.	140.35960388183594
whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr bennet were dead.	523.2130737304688
only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"	287.6667785644531
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	39.81342315673828
"it is a long time, mr bingley, since you went away," said mrs bennet.	198.39439392089844
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	70.33776092529297
it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	57.80915069580078
"no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose.	138.43585205078125
is not he a charming man?	28.007232666015625
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	41.93836212158203
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	910.5126342773438
donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	1.472418189048767
oh!	121.09069061279297
"yes--the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	208.70301818847656
my
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of mr wickham.	436.8199768066406
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	222.79644775390625
in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	330.5101318359375
mr
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn
family; jane heard them with horror.	319.7039794921875
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	218.93385314941406
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	156.28086853027344
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."	79.4737548828125
"i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	126.87594604492188
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	181.51785278320312
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	194.4125213623047
he could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	202.95407104492188
their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	95.26068878173828
"he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling.	65.31144714355469
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	107.34431457519531
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	102.32283020019531
"i had much rather go in the coach."	258.48992919921875
as she pronounced these words, mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	108.27313995361328
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!	54.632057189941406
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	146.2938995361328
i was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth
     and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	32.26312255859375
"how could
you begin?"	139.6115264892578
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	89.83905029296875
she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings.	212.4019317626953
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	139.10137939453125
she could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	103.95455169677734
i appeal to mr darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	58.980960845947266
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	118.779052734375
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	182.1640167236328
my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	144.5758819580078
"you can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	145.9280548095703
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	130.9997100830078
such a countenance, such manners!	135.81277465820312
for what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"	32.895172119140625
lord bless me!	291.25482177734375
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	115.68403625488281
but though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	101.44185638427734
can it be really so!	190.15878295898438
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	107.8902587890625
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	169.2933807373047
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	311.33575439453125
at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	51.86071014404297
"i am sure there is not on _his_.	98.83478546142578
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	336.7181701660156
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.	155.7398223876953
in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to mrs collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	37.98769760131836
"you are quite right.	159.48814392089844
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	111.48371887207031
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	261.9007263183594
it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	173.40330505371094
she answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"my eldest sister has been in town these three months.	95.3441162109375
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	140.9825439453125
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
pemberley.	58.35477828979492
sir william only smiled.	228.5094757080078
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	241.1274871826172
if you
do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the
rules is very easy.	124.62530517578125
"i have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	111.15409851074219
my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says.	177.19847106933594
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!	153.03195190429688
"she is my youngest girl but one.	44.317901611328125
i am ashamed of you!	116.32774353027344
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	146.08079528808594
she cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving wickham.	150.58953857421875
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	154.8057403564453
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.	215.1065216064453
in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	213.97659301757812
elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	157.85382080078125
"when i consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew
what he was.	179.58961486816406
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	274.75677490234375
you give me
fresh life and vigour.	28.060476303100586
elizabeth was forced to go.	133.42803955078125
she tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr
darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	217.41268920898438
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"	127.17867279052734
"by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.	63.64309310913086
at present i will
say nothing about it."	245.63450622558594
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	110.05216217041016
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	254.4502716064453
he resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.	215.31011962890625
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	155.63453674316406
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	320.14605712890625
elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	225.92266845703125
"fitzwilliam darcy."	172.05911254882812
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	68.8520736694336
if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	57.16036605834961
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	123.15763854980469
i dare say mr bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	176.24356079101562
she asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then
observed,

"your father's estate is entailed on mr collins, i think.	95.93140411376953
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	55.74553298950195
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."	39.64695358276367
"i should not mind any thing at all."	71.36737823486328
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	264.8122253417969
but, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	326.90264892578125
"yours, &c."

as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	286.57574462890625
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out.	338.78173828125
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	107.9998550415039
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by wickham.	149.86123657226562
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	1459.772705078125
come be quick, be quick!	250.51817321777344
"dear madam," cried mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from mr gardiner?	50.812015533447266
i congratulate her.	222.31710815429688
the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	693.344970703125
"and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	161.23468017578125
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	117.77645111083984
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	283.4358825683594
she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	35.699039459228516
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	235.35977172851562
she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but mrs bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	284.1997375488281
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.	114.8816146850586
but i hope you will not mind it: it is
all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	30.27438735961914
good bye."	139.12367248535156
"upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except netherfield.	201.28585815429688
she
could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	84.22097778320312
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	75.39029693603516
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.	172.82704162597656
