generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her
luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and
setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to
inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent
waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to
render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:
the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the
admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,

age bloom would be 54. in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen
would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,

surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of

stephen: how is that?	28308.287109375
what rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate

but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him.	3466.69873046875
and her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and

she felt a kind of a

wagnerian music, though
confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to
follow at the first go-off but the music of mercadante’s _huguenots_,
meyerbeer’s _seven last words on the cross_ and mozart’s _twelfth mass_
he simply revelled in, the _gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the

she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip
up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a
lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece

because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see

edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti
eis_ and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and
asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she
heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	420.8184509277344

postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was

be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules: of
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90

secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke

imaginary: thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand
lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street:
fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverist’s
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverist’s revelations of white
articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing

sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine

mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he
felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly

for instance when the
evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely
in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	1661.7720947265625

he closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an

resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its

stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	2398.964599609375
influential friends.	3999.212646484375
in vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through trinity gates.	1382.733642578125
does
anybody really?	3055.46142578125
that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as plato’s.	491.9164733886719
holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is
landed.	2798.01513671875
he provokes my intelligence.	205.53196716308594
he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	1017.6928100585938
stephen: panting.	606.54833984375

the lord
mayor was there, val dillon it was, and sir charles cameron and dan
dawson spoke and there was music.	879.0958862304688
mrs breen: she did, of course, the cat!	897.1494140625

we’ll manure you, mr flower!	4994.91796875
go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.	4132.26123046875
a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	2149.878662109375
the fire brigade: pflaap!	7003.1708984375
catch them once with

the colours were done something lovely.	1058.3516845703125
mrs yelverton barry: shame on him!	209.3820343017578
a most instructive discussion.	114.74803161621094
mrs cunningham: sings.	22.801258087158203

he went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
black church.	3371.845947265625
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	5586.49853515625
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	6.243297576904297
short but to the point


whose land?	816.549560546875
if you.	153.4788360595703
o, that be damned for a story, mr dedalus said.	4843.34619140625
the best death, mr bloom said.	4128.6767578125
for such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve.	106.4405746459961
stephen: he had three brothers, gilbert, edmund, richard.	1255.6318359375

poor dignam!	9582.787109375
let us go round by the chief’s grave, hynes said.	3037.540771484375
is it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been
prince hamlet’s twin, is it possible, i want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?	9383.56640625
certainly, i
sort of believe strong in you, mr president.	240.2133026123047
is that boylan well off?	120.72782135009766

because
he closed my carriage door outside sir thornley stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
