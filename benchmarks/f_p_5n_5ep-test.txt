268.750732421875
she was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	165.21519470214844
my situation in life, my connections
with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	207.66061401367188
"my dear friend,

     "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.	325.51202392578125
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	56.90462112426758
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	555.381591796875
are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"	87.96540069580078
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	34.939334869384766
their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	58.51973342895508
but they did pass away, and mr and
mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn.	142.8464813232422
"i hope, my dear," said mr bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	92.70958709716797
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	141.422607421875
she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley's inattention.	48.3258171081543
"what is it you mean?"	210.59693908691406
"oh!	27.368244171142578
i grieve to
     find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared w. was not a man to be trusted.	198.60337829589844
one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	114.06262969970703
he generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	1229.9449462890625
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	963.2579956054688
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	116.0307388305664
mr gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	118.53649139404297
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."	226.0584259033203
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."	170.72193908691406
"sometimes.	525.28466796875
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same;
and mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss
bennet.	180.3870849609375
this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	219.72357177734375
he spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided.	86.72100067138672
she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	286.4599914550781
colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	50.8366813659668
"but why all this secrecy?	551.9629516601562
"thank you--but i always mend my own."	139.33001708984375
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."	191.5185089111328
"it is well.	20.956012725830078
how mr darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	23.137493133544922
and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,

"dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr collins must excuse
me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	108.8624267578125
1.f.4.	117.56261444091797
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy,
were to entertain each other.	131.99566650390625
she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will
be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my
good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage
every thing.	122.43688201904297
no, no, this is not likely.	87.0203628540039
her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	849.5044555664062
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	54.71702194213867
ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!	49.451969146728516
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	90.82727813720703
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	142.2202606201172
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	52.26179885864258
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	211.52162170410156
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	151.0160369873047
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	76.96398162841797
i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	61.701324462890625
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	811.091552734375
_you_
may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer."	385.3522644042969
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	98.33924102783203
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	68.05809783935547
elizabeth smiled.	117.58605194091797
they have at
least that advantage."	235.8904571533203
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	116.87702178955078
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	106.21617126464844
must it be so?"	154.8216094970703
"sure he
will not leave london before he has found them.	187.89434814453125
why does she not come in?"	71.2909164428711
everything wore
a happier aspect.	109.7127914428711
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."	224.51258850097656
but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable.	368.29315185546875
the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	276.09283447265625
he observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it
is above eight months.	132.93003845214844
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	198.61439514160156
but your
_family_ owe me nothing.	1883.0023193359375
u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.	1889.4754638671875
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	136.29324340820312
"i am trying to make it out."	70.73954010009766
i do not wish to avoid the walk.	49.64089584350586
nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the united states.	228.25550842285156
i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	162.11097717285156
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	351.8005065917969
how can mr bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	481.9602966308594
with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."	205.68344116210938
well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man mr stone.	133.80982971191406
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	188.23916625976562
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	122.7830581665039
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	175.21449279785156
i will
think no more about him."	58.491920471191406
"i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	376.2261962890625
let wickham
be _your_ man.	3619.89599609375
i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	538.09228515625
after making
     every possible enquiry on that side london, colonel f. came on into
     hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.	188.7041473388672
"yes, ma'am, all."	29.99880599975586
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects.	344.5206604003906
do not distress me by the idea.	204.35118103027344
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	902.2864990234375
let me hear what it is."	10.977005958557129
it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	114.24742889404297
we want none of them;
do we?"	287.840087890625
"where is your sister?"	41.21702575683594
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	179.67578125
cried his wife impatiently.	339.62994384765625
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	790.8804321289062
whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."	48.886985778808594
but he found lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	798.2015380859375
her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	394.6990661621094
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	53.47734069824219
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and mr collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	164.68356323242188
mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	901.0078735351562
adieu to disappointment and spleen.	236.66793823242188

updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

after
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	164.86624145507812
he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	198.8599090576172
"if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes."	120.67084503173828
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	148.8880615234375
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."	52.21159744262695
it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	125.15393829345703
they then went away.	13.8182954788208
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	68.4043960571289
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	114.16309356689453
the one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	552.2158813476562
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	121.214599609375
an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	29.132404327392578
_you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	438.7542724609375
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come."	295.21942138671875
do not repeat what i then said.	371.88714599609375
this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	512.5632934570312
a low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	156.78858947753906
i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."	72.99162292480469
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said,

"i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	126.95407104492188
i do not trust my own
partiality.	92.36064910888672
"you must not blame my aunt.	292.88848876953125
and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose?	266.4115905761719
"not at all."	32.040000915527344
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	287.6803283691406
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"well, jane, who is it from?	97.48444366455078
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	157.20901489257812
"are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"	129.2264862060547
you do not look
well.	37.785865783691406
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	37.368709564208984
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	208.8685760498047
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	264.0223083496094
"and have you heard from him often?"	133.53587341308594
after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer.	118.26554870605469
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the
head quarters.	280.4676513671875
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	151.28744506835938
with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	242.94314575195312
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends.	170.05699157714844
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	258.8031005859375
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!	104.9690933227539
lady catherine, sir william, and mr and mrs collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her
party.	74.60454559326172
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt
that i _should_ be looked at.	120.97462463378906
mrs bennet said only, "nonsense,
nonsense!"	448.474853515625
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	122.98820495605469
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"	164.86544799804688
if you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."	68.16573333740234
and so would anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	427.3685607910156
wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	102.6841812133789
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	97.0873031616211
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour, till sir william thus began.	242.66192626953125
about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	603.718017578125
"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	286.75396728515625
lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	192.60015869140625
but i knew i should
persuade you at last.	145.8511199951172
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	45.363128662109375
you blamed me for coming?"	101.74031066894531
i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better."	56.63595199584961
my dear jane, mr collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	61.58757019042969
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."	171.40826416015625
you promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	58.212120056152344
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	238.73431396484375
very odd!--and you only the
second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your
younger sisters must be very young?"	125.72966003417969
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty.	83.38731384277344
five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs
bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	87.64091491699219
if
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	226.81834411621094
there was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	749.7068481445312
give me farther particulars.	1420.9947509765625
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	147.36412048339844
mr darcy!	26.71592140197754
let me do it without farther loss of time.	1036.194091796875
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	94.12384033203125
_hunsford, near westerham, kent,

     15th october._

     dear sir,

     the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the
     misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"there, mrs bennet."	231.71861267089844

is it true?"	497.3717346191406
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."	144.77882385253906
"your first position is false.	172.49598693847656
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	147.45404052734375
colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	210.1622772216797
"and is this all?"	113.02835845947266
all that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the london road.	248.609375
when my niece georgiana went to
ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady
anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i
am excessively attentive to all those things.	202.612060546875
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	214.43777465820312
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	71.0135269165039
mr gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	490.6968994140625
his countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	291.7367248535156
but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	455.732421875
every thing being settled between _them_, mr darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	229.97052001953125
it was agreed to.	37.651790618896484
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth,

"i am glad you are come back, lizzy."	202.3588104248047
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	110.3773193359375
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	651.3895263671875
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	1102.53173828125
"lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say.	35.903160095214844
1813.




pride & prejudice.	2830.208984375
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	167.611328125
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	115.83074951171875
lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	172.85488891601562
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr darcy," she cried; "i
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	390.0255432128906
he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	237.1243133544922
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."	351.1806945800781
it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	235.49684143066406
but, lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or jane at most.	200.24163818359375
she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	266.4452819824219
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	86.13459777832031
"so much the better.	55.31596374511719
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	2702.011962890625
"of what are you talking?"	43.36802673339844
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	96.68016052246094
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her."	81.55786895751953
perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.	175.73509216308594
she was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr
wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	182.5426788330078
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what
say you to the day?	84.74205017089844
"that is very strange.	25.643795013427734
if elizabeth, when mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	209.11453247070312
the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	716.99951171875
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	168.75807189941406
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	289.9696960449219
"but to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	236.05450439453125
--and
upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
mr collins."	433.6780090332031
"can you deny that you have done it?"	83.51959228515625
"after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	144.1306610107422
"i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	201.0534210205078
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.	53.50864791870117
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.	186.7871856689453
"you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	60.54829025268555
they will have nothing else to
do."	18.36841583251953
"this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	600.3363647460938
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	99.71829986572266
it was to this effect:

     "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.	339.13232421875
"one of them does."	52.094078063964844
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	432.3059997558594
i will try again.	100.01278686523438
but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	371.7598571777344
when mr collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	378.94561767578125
he was on one side of her mother.	42.01597595214844
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	123.057373046875
sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	433.7574157714844
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	24.050294876098633
she got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	126.0108642578125
"if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as
you.	89.30302429199219
a lively imagination soon settled it all.	193.5832977294922
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	99.67855834960938
by many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	158.9093780517578
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	125.08055877685547
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr
bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	144.50186157226562
but it is all, all too late now."	233.5374298095703
good heaven!	248.94129943847656
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs gardiner, "i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	59.799293518066406
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my
cards."	143.2545166015625
but
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	80.87974548339844
"dear sir,

     "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	325.54229736328125
"do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	202.7895050048828
he expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	201.05592346191406
such a charming man!--so handsome!	123.60569763183594
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr darcy!"	54.121009826660156
but i confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	70.10945892333984
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project
gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	389.136474609375
she is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--your's, &c.

     "e.	160.6153564453125
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	637.4581298828125
she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	130.20909118652344
"i mention it, because it is the living which i ought to have had.	680.0814819335938
"dearest jane!	105.95646667480469
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	121.36914825439453
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable
house.	1471.9859619140625
the path just admitted three.	241.0363311767578
to mrs gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	85.4887466430664
you both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	796.1423950195312
though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	81.1682357788086
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	281.1127624511719
my object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise."	33.57233428955078
"yes, almost every day."	362.75469970703125
such a disappointment!	355.33843994140625
i send no compliments to your
mother.	77.65606689453125
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	157.0065155029297
not handsome enough to dance with!	26.611665725708008
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know."	92.37769317626953
"my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you.	140.47315979003906
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do."	28.683368682861328
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	172.71728515625
elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley.	114.5879898071289
"i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	756.2642211914062
_their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	57.20134353637695
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	54.17832946777344
elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name.	232.6627960205078
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	211.9136199951172
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	110.29954528808594
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	74.53958892822266
i wonder what he can be doing there."	380.6644592285156
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough.	40.991878509521484
"and do you really know all this?"	127.73661041259766
it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	104.98841857910156
we do not suffer by _accident_.	87.37694549560547
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	63.663150787353516
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	27.368244171142578
"oh!	149.1105194091797
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	169.87619018554688
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	663.718505859375
in
understanding darcy was the superior.	253.68870544433594
but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	416.9592590332031
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more
than i ever look into."	98.64461517333984
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	332.6778869628906
"why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	87.86369323730469
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr
bennet coolly observed,

"from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	469.568603515625
we will go round the park every day.	181.73193359375
you had much better
dance."	2471.34814453125
why must their
marriage be private?	315.63775634765625
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	87.57207489013672
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	75.68644714355469
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	180.8976287841797
for your
sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss
bennet?"	132.59957885742188
"not so hasty, if you please.	144.94703674316406
you will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	31.698558807373047
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	249.09222412109375
many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	203.52662658691406
they were all astonished; and mr bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."	125.50576782226562
you have done all this!	176.07177734375
after a short pause,
her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	73.626220703125
it was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	377.9716491699219
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley."	169.6968536376953
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."	18.202476501464844
darcy made no answer.	166.96192932128906
he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	434.0331726074219
from
what can it proceed?	914.8327026367188
for
my part, mr bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	2072.595947265625
compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	357.04913330078125
"undoubtedly.	153.10537719726562
he
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	51.919315338134766
it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	98.36227416992188
_i_ did for you.	328.6062927246094
there are a lot of things you can do with project
gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic
works.	83.95462036132812
"if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.	384.1382751464844
lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	265.0487365722656
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	292.2863464355469
"you need not distress yourself.	343.36785888671875
the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	217.85549926757812
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.	144.60733032226562
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	519.3949584960938
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	32.94620132446289
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to
say.	277.1214904785156
she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	263.3128356933594
"she
looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	49.799049377441406
she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	165.9624481201172
these
were the contents:

     "my dear harriet,

     "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
     missed.	295.8538513183594
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."	32.57680892944336
i did not wink at you."	659.1990356445312
what will wickham say?	288.0814514160156
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "ah!	69.00747680664062
"perhaps we might be deceived."	113.78645324707031
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	63.5790901184082
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	210.11557006835938
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	800.1720581054688
"but consider your daughters.	287.2413024902344
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	33.8659782409668
we must not make him desperate."	74.48997497558594
but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	89.70394897460938
you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	86.80010223388672
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	88.798828125
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,"
said she, "though i am _not_ her particular friend.	85.24874114990234
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	73.05242156982422
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."	258.78271484375
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	35.48101806640625
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	63.72453308105469
"but what is to be
done about pemberley?"	28.757699966430664
"no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."	93.27890014648438
but his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	32.558746337890625
end of the second volume.	412.0353088378906
mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	44.99018478393555
very
nonsensical to come at all!	261.6570739746094
i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."	104.84429168701172
lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and mr collins, in describing the civility of mr and
mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	107.52751159667969
nobody wants him to come.	90.97352600097656
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	60.40821838378906
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	111.28578186035156
any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.	220.94459533691406
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."	16.22472381591797
"oh, lord!	219.6281280517578
but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr darcy walk into the
room.	72.93140411376953
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	46.66157531738281
the
other is miss de bourgh.	112.1971664428711
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	82.14099884033203
as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	107.47660827636719
cried bingley.	314.0031433105469
never, even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at
rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings.	145.97177124023438
mr collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	57.043800354003906
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	211.3303680419922
have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	35.604061126708984
they must have seen them together for ever."	47.9027214050293
how well
it sounds.	151.1790008544922
elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	56.411407470703125
this is your final resolve!	40.18052673339844
but do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	326.7244873046875
he could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	140.90162658691406
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	141.09243774414062
can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?"	61.039093017578125
the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	172.2287139892578
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	157.2156219482422
let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."	1376.9462890625
this idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	46.146873474121094
if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them."	261.5611267089844
jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	173.0074462890625
but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	474.2327575683594
there
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom mr darcy could have
such boundless influence.	76.43437194824219
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	196.70944213867188
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	126.35334014892578
to mr bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	228.6214141845703
for such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	67.06090545654297
on distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	80.67124938964844
cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and mr darcy appeared.	35.67705535888672
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	47.899078369140625
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and
i hope you will consent to be of the party.	122.85580444335938
his behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	128.5709686279297
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	138.3253936767578
but now it was all too natural.	262.5105895996094
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	30.303478240966797
elizabeth now began to revive.	41.993186950683594
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	50.545005798339844
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	161.1014404296875
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	74.36857604980469
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	183.4970703125
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	94.65607452392578
do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	205.8711395263672
kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	109.50659942626953
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	40.743804931640625
if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	112.19732666015625
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	182.9994354248047
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	337.9267883300781
my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	27.368244171142578
"oh!	211.7142333984375
i am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	69.43209838867188
i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	146.77078247070312
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."	163.87274169921875
as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	45.657413482666016
see
paragraph 1.c below.	80.74082946777344
"yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	19.02520751953125
my dear," continued mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	52.347843170166016
"yes.	190.4332733154297
he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	154.56475830078125
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."	117.29317474365234
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either.	112.46353149414062
on the following monday, mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at
longbourn.	38.324745178222656
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	110.49295043945312
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.	60.36027908325195
"yes, very well.	319.7120666503906
i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	57.58744812011719
"i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would
not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	259.96099853515625
"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	170.8385467529297
lady lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty.	64.627197265625
but what does he say of the living?"	47.76153564453125
we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	45.454769134521484
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."	43.08916473388672
i am not romantic you know.	255.42251586914062
she
certainly did not hate him.	481.9724426269531
he was
angry.	253.58847045898438
her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	206.32891845703125
it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you.	563.1259155273438
my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	67.10127258300781
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of mr darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.	210.04164123535156
"they
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr bingley and his sisters."	240.43218994140625
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	163.16505432128906
she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	2267.1044921875
where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	82.27532958984375

pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."	36.51336669921875
she felt that she had no business at
pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	214.4003448486328
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	34.22518539428711
i don't know.	138.443115234375
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!	135.61895751953125
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	23.541255950927734
"that it ought not to be attempted.	364.86224365234375
she stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	180.72561645507812
"let her be called down.	83.49407196044922
and what sort of young lady is she?	180.96258544921875

     as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn.	54.72122573852539

humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn.	337.53564453125

but i am at his disposal.	114.45484924316406
"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is
about."	77.5086441040039
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	71.29591369628906
but here he was set right by mrs bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	66.51460266113281
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	85.6175765991211
do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"	372.84564208984375
she knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	3897.535888671875

finer county in england than derbyshire."	50.530155181884766
she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	156.91221618652344
wickham is safe."	187.84364318847656
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"oh!	92.53388977050781
jane, i take your place now, and you must go
lower, because i am a married woman."	193.28924560546875

72 of la belle assemblee 1^{st} july 1815_]




pride & prejudice.	201.75633239746094
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	73.7490234375
"it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	271.3565368652344
we had better not mention it.	232.93209838867188
"lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	186.91236877441406
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, i am determined.	49.116580963134766
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	109.24311828613281
catherine and lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	81.56665802001953
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	30.741371154785156
"'tis too much!"	61.88716506958008
since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	54.61593246459961
have not you always hated him?"	238.98455810546875
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	101.172119140625
in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	207.78500366210938
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucas's last week; and even mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least.	109.26187896728516
teaze him--laugh at
him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	2900.33447265625
the visit
was returned in due form.	81.0401840209961
let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	46.573246002197266
but she would not be secure.	131.1575927734375
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	109.8310317993164
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
what to think."	150.031494140625
mrs bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	64.55889129638672
well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	135.79600524902344
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	110.81232452392578
you must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     project gutenberg-tm works.	96.8099365234375
mrs
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	97.96884155273438
your's, &c.

     "edw.	206.5223388671875
lady
catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.	355.77960205078125
lady catherine seemed resigned.	288.64605712890625
the miss
webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--do you draw?"	13177.3369140625
"neglect!	85.32157897949219
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	514.5222778320312
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	157.07174682617188
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"you, who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	58.20659637451172
we now come to the point.	119.42597961425781
i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance.	92.16632843017578
had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	114.8428955078125
you shall not defend her,
though it is charlotte lucas.	24.74779510498047
said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	24.439374923706055
mrs collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure."	88.21204376220703
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	80.99935150146484
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	180.38125610351562
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	148.47666931152344
his most particular
friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	85.6905288696289
she mentioned this to her friend miss
lucas.	70.09210968017578
there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."	104.15991973876953
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	132.716552734375
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	481.2196960449219
the person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.	161.05833435058594
thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	71.47404479980469
at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends."	95.41630554199219
he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	373.6176452636719
mrs hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	439.4636535644531
i never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	97.8207778930664
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild."	38.54908752441406
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	78.68805694580078
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	89.229736328125
it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	39.46779251098633
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to
think."	226.6414794921875
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	80.44734191894531
if this be the case, he deserves you.	179.64297485351562
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	224.93577575683594
her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	166.18853759765625
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	68.3223876953125
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	642.9989624023438
the younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's
dying an old maid.	54.105777740478516
she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	61.828468322753906
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	104.95633697509766
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	114.50486755371094
putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	138.1250762939453
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	99.16381072998047
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	220.51329040527344
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	171.31011962890625
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable.	148.49172973632812
he
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	59.96236038208008
there he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	237.69430541992188
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	144.6242218017578
but i can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."	5427.12060546875
but gracious me!	127.41595458984375
how can they suit each other?--do you
know mr bingley?"	71.0670166015625
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	156.0643768310547
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy
had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	51.06179428100586
"we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	211.5636749267578
she read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	94.44678497314453
that he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr gardiner.	101.68783569335938
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	102.91236114501953
it was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	26.462644577026367
i am the happiest creature in
     the world.	205.0943603515625
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."	351.0606689453125
"neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	163.81350708007812
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	223.4543914794922
your sister i also watched.--her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have
     been in an error.	34.40858840942383
single, my dear, to be sure!	84.8311996459961
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."	163.8442840576172
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	21.811649322509766
dear, dear lizzy.	70.52815246582031
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	92.01451873779297
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."	85.57537841796875
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	208.60693359375
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	364.6816711425781
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.	118.63805389404297
he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."	103.90509033203125
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs
gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	711.46728515625
i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	202.33758544921875
--said jane as she
finished it.	98.38797760009766
she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	229.24560546875
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	348.1701354980469
not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr darcy
returned within the stated time.	264.2345275878906
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	27.368244171142578
"oh!	131.91046142578125
you agree that the foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage.	142.2548370361328
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	207.11355590820312
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	112.83810424804688
the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.	117.56261444091797
1.e.9.	83.69660949707031
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs
philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	230.29632568359375
he was full of joy and
attention.	74.67726135253906
"that is to say, you had given your permission.	495.580810546875
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	131.5617218017578
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all.	64.3617935180664
no, no,
you shall not deceive me.	1543.3145751953125
i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."	123.74942016601562
had lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	109.25718688964844
after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."	54.89234924316406
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	1163.534912109375
"an easy distance do you call it?	250.46298217773438
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	227.71348571777344
bingley
was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	337.5304870605469
no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy.	84.11353302001953
mr collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	195.07406616210938
as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	190.08590698242188
you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	201.0776824951172
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	422.2924499511719
but so they always are.	100.0153579711914
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	98.96333312988281
i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	108.95346069335938
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"oh, papa, what news?	120.44508361816406
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible
that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	91.7482681274414
elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	27.368244171142578
"oh!	80.3604965209961
he really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	70.10030364990234
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	3065.53955078125
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	459.0665588378906
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	121.95693969726562
he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	135.8960723876953
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	60.22279739379883
why was he to be the judge?"	35.047325134277344
you are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	139.1316375732422
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	127.75665283203125
"_mr darcy_, you see, is the man!	387.4643249511719
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	201.00848388671875
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	439.19073486328125
she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	173.44688415527344
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	130.40830993652344
it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."	144.87477111816406
from something that he told me in
our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him.	350.0618591308594
this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself."	290.58966064453125
"you shall have it in few words.	515.7344970703125
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	141.9451904296875
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	13.380123138427734
oh!	47.80535888671875
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	211.0985107421875
he readily agreed to it.	466.31402587890625
i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."	154.95596313476562
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at pemberley.	111.42132568359375
but that
gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."	209.77427673339844
i saw them the night before last."	179.99331665039062
if _i_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."	40.350711822509766
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	339.9998474121094
replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	34.708377838134766
my
father, however, is partial to mr wickham.	951.1680297851562
but you know married women have never much time for
writing.	177.3687286376953
i cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.	204.83078002929688
it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its

the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	102.00821685791016
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	70.20487213134766
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	56.92997360229492
have all her friends left her?"	706.7574462890625
he immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	88.24583435058594
i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	338.40924072265625
it must be an amusing study."	58.843849182128906
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	434.00152587890625
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	425.4732666015625
elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	91.04448699951172
*       *       *       *       *

mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	51.02558898925781
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	80.66905975341797
it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	414.3843688964844
miss lucas is married and settled.	188.68084716796875
a lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	169.61685180664062
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	112.25768280029297
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	112.23409271240234
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	43.1038703918457
he did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september, than any body else in the country.	4115.3857421875
that tall, proud man."	47.34391403198242
as long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	289.4440612792969
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	114.05338287353516
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	300.34796142578125
if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	311.9863586425781
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr
bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	50.257476806640625
"no, i believe not."	129.48300170898438
"my object _then_," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	95.90922546386719
it was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.	259.27392578125
how strange must it appear to him!	435.2886047363281
he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	74.45429229736328
could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life
     saw him so affected.	1248.225830078125
we _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	57.55736541748047
repeated mr bennet.	25.784746170043945
mr bennet replied that he had not.	17.168720245361328
what is your own opinion?"	158.85513305664062
"no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."	52.84323501586914
i would go and see her, if i could have the
carriage."	724.5302734375
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	181.3817596435547
i
never was.	90.32015991210938
in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	119.7964096069336
he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, i am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	89.04670715332031
"if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	69.03695678710938
"i do not get on at all.	48.31845474243164
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr
bingley, if she could.	17.909809112548828
"your humility, mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	91.27125549316406
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	46.271697998046875
we
shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some
balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all."	121.28844451904297
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought
only of _you_."	271.38580322265625
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	414.60968017578125
mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	170.31399536132812
he called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.	88.36579132080078
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning.	527.39990234375
bingley urged mr jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	114.9539566040039
charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	151.6334686279297
lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	148.09596252441406
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	74.64401245117188
find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.'	295.1940612792969
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	208.53152465820312
the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	51.92885971069336
"for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her.	898.35107421875
_she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	65.25584411621094
in every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	803.4876708984375
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	80.9080581665039
will you come and see me?"	130.73468017578125
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at!"	104.02208709716797
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards mr wickham.	1140.7852783203125
the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	72.7656021118164
she was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr darcy said very
little, and mr hurst nothing at all.	177.33396911621094
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	336.27099609375
never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	112.86845397949219
but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	1127.761962890625
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	76.1182632446289
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	341.10833740234375
had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	96.28317260742188
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	30.29271697998047
why did she come?	105.87983703613281
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr
darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	231.4622039794922
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	581.5294799804688
i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	162.8349609375
i declare i do not
know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."	56.0158805847168
and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment.	73.60073852539062
i will go directly to mr bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	87.4548568725586
she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	335.6859436035156
and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	138.56951904296875
about ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire, to which he belonged.	35.15871810913086
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	1637.4212646484375
he knows where we live.	393.4556579589844
one seems so forlorn without them."	105.14774322509766
the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	145.08595275878906
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	106.69231414794922
it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	818.8973388671875
had colonel forster seen denny himself?"	25.54957389831543
it cannot be.	27.368244171142578
"oh!	83.70970153808594
"it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	88.91449737548828
"ten thousand pounds!	69.2531509399414
"i think she will.	37.90438461303711
that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr darcy!	173.8841094970703
in
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	391.44525146484375
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	173.2697296142578
"and men take care that they should."	204.79881286621094
she declared her resolution.	204.18519592285156
"true.	74.92587280273438
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or
rather taller."	42.34743881225586
"mr bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	234.9182586669922
"what should not you mind?"	247.30172729492188
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	20.07871437072754
"i cannot believe it.	51.532779693603516
he did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.	84.41791534423828
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure
you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."	186.8327178955078
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	344.7349548339844
i
     must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.	559.7913818359375
"she did indeed, louisa.	105.77518463134766
a
little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	205.11575317382812
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet.	51.308433532714844
"i cannot make him
out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	288.09588623046875
thoughtless and indiscreet i
     can easily believe him, but this step and let us rejoice over it
     marks nothing bad at heart.	76.80831146240234
he was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"just as you please."	127.24272918701172
she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	301.2435607910156
what a stroke was this for poor jane!	210.71697998046875

oh, lizzy!	64.43814086914062
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	65.61060333251953
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	98.15190887451172
to these high
flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	103.00269317626953
had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	220.90846252441406
i only hope they may have half my
good luck.	34.60385513305664
"you cannot be too much on your guard.	665.8090209960938
in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	13.380123138427734
oh!	292.8824768066406
into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	181.04612731933594
and
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	51.89836120605469
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_."	151.1606903076172
he came to tell mr gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia
     once.	142.2888946533203
and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	110.52030181884766
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	320.2457580566406
her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	323.95587158203125
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	132.7279815673828
they will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from
     mrs gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the south.	118.6727294921875
"and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."	139.5231475830078
i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	68.6667251586914
however, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	1039.736328125
royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax
     returns.	52.09578323364258
"you have.	202.0177001953125
we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."	80.42301940917969
"yours, &c."

"well, my dear," said mr bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr bingley, and under your orders."	190.48422241210938
every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	217.83741760253906
he never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr
and mrs collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	316.6951904296875
lydia laughed, and said,

"aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	72.75929260253906
i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	85.05802154541016
"i certainly shall not.	111.49239349365234
you need not send them word at
     longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
     wickham.	173.59986877441406
had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"	38.83753204345703
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."	209.96923828125
a carat character is used to denote superscription.	193.6622314453125
his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	47.77149200439453
they must all go to brighton.	155.18798828125
"how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say.--_you_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	20.121320724487305
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	355.02667236328125
he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	114.5019760131836
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	102.85750579833984
"with my mother up stairs.	79.90077209472656
he has
     more to give.	178.9192352294922
she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	200.38755798339844
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	152.3201904296875
this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	142.92239379882812
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	157.52049255371094
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	210.59832763671875
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	85.51516723632812
who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	5.891003131866455
thank heaven!	82.6308822631836
"bingley."	521.572021484375
he did trace them easily to
     clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from epsom.	440.04241943359375
the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	173.75209045410156
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	42.0250129699707
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."	64.25514221191406
"no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension.	660.8872680664062
i will only add, god bless you.	175.75746154785156
from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	122.33429718017578
they were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	204.06471252441406
"only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away;
it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	309.39422607421875
he heard her with astonishment.	178.50473022460938
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss
bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	93.3132095336914
but let me advise you to think better of it.	128.17039489746094
"impossible, mr bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	83.00603485107422
they met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed.	48.826454162597656
he was well, but so much
engaged with mr darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	70.42292785644531
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	24.27594566345215
"upon my word," said mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	71.35934448242188
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	94.72235107421875
she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley.	515.6885375976562
well, much good may it do them!	205.60067749023438
her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	531.7837524414062
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	285.4387512207031
they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	780.309326171875
i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	529.0174560546875
elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	464.7413024902344
if mr darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	47.74007797241211
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr
wickham and herself.	139.74681091308594
i dearly love a
laugh."	17.989511489868164
mr darcy bowed.	20.13628578186035
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	306.1812744140625
if he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	14.631148338317871
gardiner."	488.428466796875
a clear ten
thousand per annum.	108.02679443359375
whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr bennet were dead.	2512.5703125
only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"	374.1182556152344
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	23.323795318603516
"it is a long time, mr bingley, since you went away," said mrs bennet.	219.5746307373047
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	75.59984588623047
it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	105.66321563720703
"no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose.	278.1402893066406
is not he a charming man?	18.82776641845703
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	28.028608322143555
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	4404.7216796875
donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	13.380123138427734
oh!	115.48320007324219
"yes--the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	165.59234619140625
my
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of mr wickham.	994.9844970703125
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	146.87965393066406
in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	156.59715270996094
mr
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn
family; jane heard them with horror.	632.95654296875
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	232.6750030517578
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	174.12672424316406
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."	72.7922592163086
"i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	168.46363830566406
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	219.67401123046875
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	507.951904296875
he could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	209.2685546875
their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	335.6976013183594
"he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling.	100.28881072998047
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	174.3438262939453
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	179.93392944335938
"i had much rather go in the coach."	695.3706665039062
as she pronounced these words, mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	171.52821350097656
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!	75.0359878540039
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	121.81228637695312
i was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth
     and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	357.5475158691406
"how could
you begin?"	174.04861450195312
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	83.32344818115234
she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings.	175.98423767089844
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	78.39204406738281
she could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	94.60823822021484
i appeal to mr darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	83.12418365478516
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	84.75141906738281
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	640.0302124023438
my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	134.62728881835938
"you can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	272.33392333984375
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	331.6589660644531
such a countenance, such manners!	128.23239135742188
for what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"	33.76801681518555
lord bless me!	323.814697265625
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	104.60285186767578
but though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	202.65042114257812
can it be really so!	296.26861572265625
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	74.71965026855469
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	116.48310089111328
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	266.4825134277344
at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	133.70375061035156
"i am sure there is not on _his_.	83.97351837158203
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	251.71463012695312
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.	119.55297088623047
in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to mrs collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	48.295650482177734
"you are quite right.	382.2549743652344
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	109.26791381835938
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	568.3818359375
it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	108.79527282714844
she answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"my eldest sister has been in town these three months.	91.97113800048828
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	205.12496948242188
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
pemberley.	393.19757080078125
sir william only smiled.	565.1900024414062
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	233.3349609375
if you
do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the
rules is very easy.	232.1561279296875
"i have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	131.3864288330078
my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says.	258.20855712890625
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!	236.13262939453125
"she is my youngest girl but one.	28.408504486083984
i am ashamed of you!	90.49010467529297
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	88.16536712646484
she cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving wickham.	106.05259704589844
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	206.29733276367188
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.	319.4801025390625
in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	216.24900817871094
elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	134.4924774169922
"when i consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew
what he was.	117.44221496582031
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	1883.2833251953125
you give me
fresh life and vigour.	113.85413360595703
elizabeth was forced to go.	116.9657211303711
she tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr
darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	252.8031005859375
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"	83.06289672851562
"by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.	51.791507720947266
at present i will
say nothing about it."	272.18853759765625
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	102.3201904296875
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	352.8359069824219
he resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.	152.4141082763672
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	186.3033905029297
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	195.3552703857422
elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	996.3741455078125
"fitzwilliam darcy."	170.0621795654297
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	33.968902587890625
if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	29.067930221557617
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	136.80194091796875
i dare say mr bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	169.8441162109375
she asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then
observed,

"your father's estate is entailed on mr collins, i think.	115.48815155029297
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	57.17353057861328
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."	30.024845123291016
"i should not mind any thing at all."	88.89546203613281
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	165.36083984375
but, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	315.9380187988281
"yours, &c."

as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	236.70045471191406
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out.	560.13671875
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	96.66610717773438
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by wickham.	272.487060546875
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	3413.30419921875
come be quick, be quick!	290.2451171875
"dear madam," cried mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from mr gardiner?	65.101318359375
i congratulate her.	130.78866577148438
the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	4130.51220703125
"and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	192.03955078125
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	126.56070709228516
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	358.73779296875
she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	72.13065338134766
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	465.5142517089844
she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but mrs bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	2335.249755859375
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.	53.98316192626953
but i hope you will not mind it: it is
all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	57.403053283691406
good bye."	89.55278015136719
"upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except netherfield.	195.21644592285156
she
could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	68.17018127441406
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	200.86170959472656
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.	282.54327392578125
i dare say the
lace upon mrs hurst's gown----"

here she was interrupted again.	83.17212677001953
he owns it
himself without disguise."	171.86985778808594
