536.5279541015625
she was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	203.83441162109375
my situation in life, my connections
with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	213.7163848876953
"my dear friend,

     "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.	314.37799072265625
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	87.02613067626953
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	314.45086669921875
are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"	156.7007598876953
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	22.052194595336914
their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	123.51315307617188
but they did pass away, and mr and
mrs gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn.	352.09588623046875
"i hope, my dear," said mr bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	191.6266632080078
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	326.6470947265625
she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley's inattention.	64.89373016357422
"what is it you mean?"	41.737510681152344
"oh!	73.11724090576172
i grieve to
     find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared w. was not a man to be trusted.	166.74951171875
one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	146.2727813720703
he generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	1289.105712890625
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	624.917236328125
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for
mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	106.34823608398438
mr gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	263.8399658203125
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."	447.23260498046875
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."	154.99740600585938
"sometimes.	508.81488037109375
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same;
and mrs hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss
bennet.	313.9085388183594
this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	327.70233154296875
he spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided.	81.76990509033203
she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	377.78424072265625
colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	47.34269332885742
"but why all this secrecy?	999.1111450195312
"thank you--but i always mend my own."	230.46847534179688
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."	83.73033142089844
"it is well.	71.99152374267578
how mr darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	66.19247436523438
and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,

"dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr collins must excuse
me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	149.7042694091797
1.f.4.	80.53358459472656
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy,
were to entertain each other.	231.60116577148438
she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will
be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my
good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage
every thing.	127.2765884399414
no, no, this is not likely.	106.154541015625
her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	459.885498046875
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	128.39735412597656
ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!	150.3147735595703
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	178.146240234375
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	871.1602172851562
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	125.9776382446289
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	527.9945068359375
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	288.37542724609375
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	133.4933319091797
i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	120.88640594482422
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	2155.498779296875
_you_
may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer."	367.6036376953125
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	275.7903137207031
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	61.42836380004883
elizabeth smiled.	19.129304885864258
they have at
least that advantage."	124.56197357177734
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	278.8450622558594
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	264.9957580566406
must it be so?"	67.4585952758789
"sure he
will not leave london before he has found them.	315.2644348144531
why does she not come in?"	120.07098388671875
everything wore
a happier aspect.	228.8807830810547
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."	294.344970703125
but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable.	188.55853271484375
the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	366.1530456542969
he observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it
is above eight months.	243.5152587890625
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	223.0298614501953
but your
_family_ owe me nothing.	1165.51171875
u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.	2151.39453125
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	169.3112335205078
"i am trying to make it out."	146.30645751953125
i do not wish to avoid the walk.	43.8267707824707
nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the united states.	156.98374938964844
i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	270.70440673828125
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	625.412109375
how can mr bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	557.955322265625
with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."	127.96417236328125
well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man mr stone.	203.48275756835938
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	202.66366577148438
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	201.20697021484375
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	302.9050598144531
i will
think no more about him."	37.9229850769043
"i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	447.142822265625
let wickham
be _your_ man.	967.4533081054688
i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	978.7962036132812
after making
     every possible enquiry on that side london, colonel f. came on into
     hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.	338.9197082519531
"yes, ma'am, all."	38.54351806640625
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects.	526.0687255859375
do not distress me by the idea.	390.6764831542969
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	4769.58984375
let me hear what it is."	17.792545318603516
it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	124.30510711669922
we want none of them;
do we?"	865.5162353515625
"where is your sister?"	45.73707580566406
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	312.2383117675781
cried his wife impatiently.	398.99859619140625
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	4248.3310546875
whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."	54.861000061035156
but he found lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	2025.9652099609375
her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	655.19873046875
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	109.33128356933594
mr wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and mr collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	277.2474365234375
mrs bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	595.968505859375
adieu to disappointment and spleen.	641.9656372070312

updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

after
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	201.3643798828125
he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	203.36122131347656
"if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes."	168.00149536132812
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	264.915283203125
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."	82.66571807861328
it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	209.15982055664062
they then went away.	15.145009994506836
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	62.5458869934082
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	131.5499267578125
the one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	438.730224609375
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	198.8988037109375
an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	58.939971923828125
_you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	277.5525817871094
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come."	375.8006896972656
do not repeat what i then said.	322.34991455078125
this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	326.7874755859375
a low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	106.4970703125
i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."	137.32073974609375
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said,

"i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	128.62088012695312
i do not trust my own
partiality.	89.28446197509766
"you must not blame my aunt.	303.7511901855469
and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose?	760.666748046875
"not at all."	49.92354202270508
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	255.8647918701172
mrs bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"well, jane, who is it from?	209.50167846679688
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	340.7074279785156
"are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"	204.33538818359375
you do not look
well.	76.25235748291016
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	111.70327758789062
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	209.33993530273438
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	499.3900451660156
"and have you heard from him often?"	94.13224029541016
after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer.	192.58554077148438
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the
head quarters.	278.5769958496094
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	147.57705688476562
with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	284.96044921875
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends.	317.5931701660156
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	574.2333984375
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!	152.37705993652344
lady catherine, sir william, and mr and mrs collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her
party.	154.43487548828125
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt
that i _should_ be looked at.	125.03726959228516
mrs bennet said only, "nonsense,
nonsense!"	402.2205505371094
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	126.16242980957031
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"	195.50689697265625
if you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."	71.61933898925781
and so would anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	1610.369140625
wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	84.77522277832031
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	120.54438018798828
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour, till sir william thus began.	522.5060424804688
about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	772.1748046875
"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	197.8356170654297
lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	708.0700073242188
but i knew i should
persuade you at last.	128.95840454101562
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	160.24234008789062
you blamed me for coming?"	43.41525650024414
i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better."	156.3729248046875
my dear jane, mr collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	124.46987915039062
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."	120.31771087646484
you promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	41.24409103393555
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	230.60092163085938
very odd!--and you only the
second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your
younger sisters must be very young?"	135.40695190429688
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty.	190.08953857421875
five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs
bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	172.60276794433594
if
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	293.636474609375
there was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	762.7650146484375
give me farther particulars.	1196.8428955078125
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	185.7206268310547
mr darcy!	55.76268005371094
let me do it without farther loss of time.	206.71861267089844
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	201.10003662109375
_hunsford, near westerham, kent,

     15th october._

     dear sir,

     the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the
     misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"there, mrs bennet."	228.0880584716797

is it true?"	121.85334777832031
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."	217.3742218017578
"your first position is false.	338.7303466796875
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	220.3258819580078
colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	216.5037384033203
"and is this all?"	160.46876525878906
all that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the london road.	413.966064453125
when my niece georgiana went to
ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr darcy, of pemberley, and lady
anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i
am excessively attentive to all those things.	279.7814636230469
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	91.42330169677734
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	98.64009094238281
mr gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	253.88453674316406
his countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	288.1785888671875
but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	416.7577209472656
every thing being settled between _them_, mr darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	422.2890625
it was agreed to.	67.53567504882812
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth,

"i am glad you are come back, lizzy."	187.53256225585938
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	137.44357299804688
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	622.236083984375
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	934.7919311523438
"lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say.	31.9859561920166
1813.




pride & prejudice.	24485.9765625
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	466.19818115234375
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	93.39714813232422
lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	283.7581787109375
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr darcy," she cried; "i
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	322.61102294921875
he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	2253.163330078125
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."	395.916015625
it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	337.5932312011719
but, lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or jane at most.	199.588623046875
she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	439.1576232910156
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	133.27828979492188
"so much the better.	70.0290298461914
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	1207.935302734375
"of what are you talking?"	48.81251907348633
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	157.7745819091797
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her."	170.16819763183594
perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.	318.3160705566406
she was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr
wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	145.2270965576172
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what
say you to the day?	162.1038818359375
"that is very strange.	53.67586898803711
if elizabeth, when mr darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	123.25433349609375
the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	1159.714599609375
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	130.8856201171875
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	283.44927978515625
"but to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	436.83978271484375
--and
upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
mr collins."	413.60595703125
"can you deny that you have done it?"	87.6202392578125
"after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	154.13067626953125
"i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	934.28564453125
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.	102.72620391845703
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone.	746.49560546875
"you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	104.94352722167969
they will have nothing else to
do."	27.47129249572754
"this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	705.0065307617188
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	124.04772186279297
it was to this effect:

     "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.	434.13482666015625
"one of them does."	97.72940063476562
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	437.7900390625
i will try again.	146.7292938232422
but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	493.6993408203125
when mr collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	504.8699645996094
he was on one side of her mother.	39.83179473876953
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	245.21484375
sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	305.57000732421875
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	83.84559631347656
she got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	104.02669525146484
"if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as
you.	89.23347473144531
a lively imagination soon settled it all.	519.1780395507812
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	218.5555419921875
by many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	217.45217895507812
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	226.48191833496094
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr
bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	282.0051574707031
but it is all, all too late now."	219.09518432617188
good heaven!	129.7273712158203
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs gardiner, "i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	93.19895935058594
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my
cards."	246.02767944335938
but
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	176.1231689453125
"dear sir,

     "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	337.9403076171875
"do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	325.1490173339844
he expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	314.75372314453125
such a charming man!--so handsome!	309.2676696777344
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr darcy!"	127.41048431396484
but i confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	108.67467498779297
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project
gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	1350.189453125
she is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--your's, &c.

     "e.	150.5677947998047
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	404.1760559082031
she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	61.699058532714844
"i mention it, because it is the living which i ought to have had.	4836.8974609375
"dearest jane!	105.81619262695312
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	242.37637329101562
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable
house.	15892.7802734375
the path just admitted three.	227.01193237304688
to mrs gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	117.46562194824219
you both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	442.7818603515625
though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	163.9053955078125
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	417.4425048828125
my object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise."	27.612802505493164
"yes, almost every day."	132.88511657714844
such a disappointment!	211.85208129882812
i send no compliments to your
mother.	75.41791534423828
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	48.597442626953125
not handsome enough to dance with!	68.27369689941406
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know."	157.6660614013672
"my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you.	170.48284912109375
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do."	79.73072052001953
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	202.03677368164062
elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley.	152.40846252441406
"i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	391.138916015625
_their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	40.19239044189453
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	178.72344970703125
elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name.	334.2871398925781
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	321.742431640625
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	112.9482421875
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	122.79167175292969
i wonder what he can be doing there."	671.2066650390625
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough.	93.97773742675781
"and do you really know all this?"	354.49224853515625
it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	107.64144897460938
we do not suffer by _accident_.	79.06782531738281
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	58.76633834838867
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	73.11724090576172
"oh!	380.16363525390625
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	132.7999725341797
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	1555.14306640625
in
understanding darcy was the superior.	262.5799865722656
but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	487.5847473144531
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more
than i ever look into."	150.56683349609375
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	258.33172607421875
"why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	115.03038787841797
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr
bennet coolly observed,

"from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	301.5643615722656
we will go round the park every day.	198.09588623046875
you had much better
dance."	5646.76904296875
why must their
marriage be private?	687.4840698242188
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	164.58779907226562
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	233.7706298828125
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	129.0608367919922
for your
sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss
bennet?"	221.2721710205078
"not so hasty, if you please.	257.4848937988281
you will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	72.37923431396484
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	425.0147705078125
many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	446.4212646484375
they were all astonished; and mr bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."	75.3066177368164
you have done all this!	198.63351440429688
after a short pause,
her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	64.39264678955078
it was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	329.292236328125
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley."	189.00474548339844
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."	38.64369583129883
darcy made no answer.	167.88385009765625
he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	858.4073486328125
from
what can it proceed?	536.5570678710938
for
my part, mr bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	3597.20654296875
compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	140.64639282226562
"undoubtedly.	201.06875610351562
he
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	64.92548370361328
it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	111.80857849121094
_i_ did for you.	437.15191650390625
there are a lot of things you can do with project
gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic
works.	121.15457153320312
"if you believed it impossible to be true," said elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far.	529.1317138671875
lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	518.5550537109375
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	1851.3770751953125
"you need not distress yourself.	502.54278564453125
the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	172.61199951171875
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.	132.5481719970703
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	546.97509765625
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	38.774227142333984
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to
say.	444.41668701171875
she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	143.48094177246094
"she
looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	93.8504638671875
she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	271.58087158203125
these
were the contents:

     "my dear harriet,

     "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
     missed.	263.1863098144531
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."	40.55463409423828
i did not wink at you."	186.4624481201172
what will wickham say?	275.170166015625
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "ah!	32.89133834838867
"perhaps we might be deceived."	164.21282958984375
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	59.355892181396484
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	624.2233276367188
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	1921.61572265625
"but consider your daughters.	593.6206665039062
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	30.551443099975586
we must not make him desperate."	148.07371520996094
but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	205.81292724609375
you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	61.32114028930664
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	172.63430786132812
"i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,"
said she, "though i am _not_ her particular friend.	137.66278076171875
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	151.3134307861328
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."	347.0764465332031
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	66.70187377929688
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	288.98675537109375
"but what is to be
done about pemberley?"	60.032997131347656
"no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."	173.9658966064453
but his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	26.657032012939453
end of the second volume.	357.5023193359375
mr gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	101.11785888671875
very
nonsensical to come at all!	272.25848388671875
i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."	132.81776428222656
lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and mr collins, in describing the civility of mr and
mrs philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	334.5368347167969
nobody wants him to come.	216.0175018310547
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	53.39952087402344
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	134.5326385498047
any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.	207.23843383789062
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."	92.65653991699219
"oh, lord!	314.6324768066406
but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr darcy walk into the
room.	48.3393669128418
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	53.093788146972656
the
other is miss de bourgh.	226.28814697265625
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	161.1051025390625
as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	20.783029556274414
cried bingley.	325.5792541503906
never, even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at
rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings.	191.28221130371094
mr collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	191.11526489257812
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	403.60003662109375
have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	33.76578140258789
they must have seen them together for ever."	99.26590728759766
how well
it sounds.	224.91012573242188
elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	103.81767272949219
this is your final resolve!	91.8016128540039
but do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	209.24610900878906
he could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	271.5842590332031
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	101.07904815673828
can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?"	114.77201080322266
the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	209.652587890625
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	244.3120880126953
let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."	1223.5863037109375
this idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	82.45320892333984
if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them."	90.55401611328125
jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	436.64276123046875
but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	423.3122253417969
there
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom mr darcy could have
such boundless influence.	113.76486206054688
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	194.87417602539062
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	85.7450942993164
to mr bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	265.49383544921875
for such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	300.7257385253906
on distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	121.51171875
cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and mr darcy appeared.	57.26676559448242
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	103.59529876708984
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and
i hope you will consent to be of the party.	158.2484893798828
his behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	208.88475036621094
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	110.43953704833984
but now it was all too natural.	445.7333679199219
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	32.52748489379883
elizabeth now began to revive.	114.976318359375
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	121.04872131347656
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	359.55828857421875
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	125.56651306152344
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	292.7051696777344
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	80.05484008789062
do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	157.6177215576172
kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	243.949462890625
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	52.11005401611328
if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	64.57381439208984
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	352.8168640136719
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	289.6126403808594
my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	73.11724090576172
"oh!	266.5170593261719
i am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	108.89435577392578
i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	127.99560546875
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."	165.8226776123047
as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	14.867005348205566
see
paragraph 1.c below.	94.1956787109375
"yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	46.585933685302734
my dear," continued mrs bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	19.518674850463867
"yes.	223.49574279785156
he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	287.2311706542969
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."	113.32009887695312
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either.	191.43138122558594
on the following monday, mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at
longbourn.	74.52014923095703
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	119.40206146240234
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.	33.44277572631836
"yes, very well.	677.0867309570312
i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	132.64346313476562
"i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would
not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	238.46717834472656
"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	447.2784729003906
lady lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty.	42.47314453125
but what does he say of the living?"	99.86372375488281
we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	88.55341339111328
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."	80.53834533691406
i am not romantic you know.	494.8863220214844
she
certainly did not hate him.	2103.69921875
he was
angry.	188.13148498535156
her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	346.3587341308594
it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you.	174.7383270263672
my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	141.48973083496094
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of mr darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.	503.5600891113281
"they
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr bingley and his sisters."	1725.1524658203125
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	223.0178680419922
she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	1647.2864990234375
where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	59.49062728881836

pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."	107.8351821899414
she felt that she had no business at
pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	165.5084991455078
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	55.0433235168457
i don't know.	436.9927062988281
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!	228.94094848632812
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	52.63222885131836
"that it ought not to be attempted.	986.4923095703125
she stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	217.24851989746094
"let her be called down.	79.62938690185547
and what sort of young lady is she?	261.9508056640625
it was not all settled before monday: as soon
     as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn.	25.08492660522461

only four dances!	183.46311950683594
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn.	172.1446990966797

but i am at his disposal.	98.88648986816406
"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is
about."	79.4404525756836
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	137.5709686279297
but here he was set right by mrs bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	111.01964569091797
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	130.44076538085938
do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"	659.967041015625
she knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	1198.07958984375
there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire."	59.660926818847656
she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	181.30712890625
wickham is safe."	201.49310302734375
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"oh!	70.69876861572266
jane, i take your place now, and you must go
lower, because i am a married woman."	291.49676513671875
i will put on my things in a moment.	1144.677490234375

pride & prejudice.	440.9224548339844
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	435.2095031738281
"it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	107.5403823852539
we had better not mention it.	257.28582763671875
"lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	629.6618041992188
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, i am determined.	93.12410736083984
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	109.00542449951172
catherine and lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	77.8075180053711
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	37.6563606262207
"'tis too much!"	174.6324462890625
since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	61.44987487792969
have not you always hated him?"	272.935302734375
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	153.6310577392578
in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	250.2080078125
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucas's last week; and even mr darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least.	166.66873168945312
teaze him--laugh at
him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	3185.10107421875
the visit
was returned in due form.	85.61872100830078
let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	283.3276672363281
but she would not be secure.	124.79437255859375
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	116.9222183227539
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
what to think."	156.4149932861328
mrs bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	133.9470672607422
well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	259.05877685546875
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	196.2116241455078
you must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     project gutenberg-tm works.	157.29112243652344
mrs
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	70.99246215820312
your's, &c.

     "edw.	301.7802429199219
lady
catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.	254.1923065185547
lady catherine seemed resigned.	256.72845458984375
the miss
webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--do you draw?"	114901.84375
"neglect!	74.32106018066406
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	993.1827392578125
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	190.13839721679688
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"you, who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	53.736141204833984
we now come to the point.	136.09490966796875
i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance.	173.61618041992188
had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	94.15190124511719
you shall not defend her,
though it is charlotte lucas.	40.14390182495117
said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	28.592525482177734
mrs collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure."	63.37287521362305
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	114.16716766357422
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	255.58360290527344
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	222.1588897705078
his most particular
friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	82.85059356689453
she mentioned this to her friend miss
lucas.	106.27214050292969
there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."	69.09130096435547
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	270.0895080566406
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	911.091552734375
the person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.	319.8941345214844
thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	144.71133422851562
at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends."	141.16928100585938
he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	481.8495178222656
mrs hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	305.56591796875
i never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	151.42430114746094
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild."	51.23314666748047
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	163.24131774902344
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	115.74925231933594
it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	98.36592864990234
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to
think."	231.26051330566406
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	99.88229370117188
if this be the case, he deserves you.	356.1900634765625
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	266.79449462890625
her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	220.01376342773438
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	211.65640258789062
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	533.6732177734375
the younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's
dying an old maid.	129.91705322265625
she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	81.1654052734375
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	88.64225006103516
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	103.9220962524414
putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	1609.3704833984375
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	441.38525390625
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	165.43496704101562
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	235.50100708007812
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable.	298.3149108886719
he
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	102.40200805664062
there he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	360.4803466796875
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	121.28739929199219
but i can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."	27917.447265625
but gracious me!	159.6204376220703
how can they suit each other?--do you
know mr bingley?"	150.32272338867188
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	162.59352111816406
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy
had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	65.73065185546875
"we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	164.0312042236328
she read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	66.64985656738281
that he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr gardiner.	102.11265563964844
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	177.46075439453125
it was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	28.369565963745117
i am the happiest creature in
     the world.	155.55975341796875
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."	371.5626220703125
"neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	190.09768676757812
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	317.8031311035156
your sister i also watched.--her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have
     been in an error.	125.614013671875
single, my dear, to be sure!	147.08949279785156
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."	160.31785583496094
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	36.74397659301758
dear, dear lizzy.	92.89278411865234
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	214.17002868652344
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."	132.03634643554688
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	180.90126037597656
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	278.5376892089844
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.	151.780029296875
he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."	143.59532165527344
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs
gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	1358.20556640625
i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	70.04737091064453
--said jane as she
finished it.	243.99229431152344
she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	279.3343811035156
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	495.253662109375
not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr darcy
returned within the stated time.	267.0924987792969
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	73.11724090576172
"oh!	207.3304443359375
you agree that the foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage.	198.59686279296875
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	210.20164489746094
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	279.36834716796875
the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.	80.53358459472656
1.e.9.	156.97103881835938
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs
philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	2964.617919921875
he was full of joy and
attention.	196.70579528808594
"that is to say, you had given your permission.	1003.6727294921875
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	226.33131408691406
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all.	79.3657455444336
no, no,
you shall not deceive me.	1712.002197265625
i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."	159.38677978515625
had lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
mr darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	207.46661376953125
after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."	94.19306945800781
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	2931.914306640625
"an easy distance do you call it?	129.37840270996094
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	415.8891906738281
bingley
was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	570.7639770507812
no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy.	156.95352172851562
mr collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	201.19163513183594
as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	333.29473876953125
you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	691.0023803710938
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	199.2889862060547
but so they always are.	165.16603088378906
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	129.97776794433594
i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	190.83779907226562
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"oh, papa, what news?	142.3926239013672
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible
that mr collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	143.85745239257812
elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	73.11724090576172
"oh!	145.50025939941406
he really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	66.44676971435547
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	6204.6552734375
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	383.3300476074219
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	104.32649230957031
he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	194.93849182128906
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	155.81692504882812
why was he to be the judge?"	63.1252326965332
you are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	228.24713134765625
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	142.380126953125
"_mr darcy_, you see, is the man!	503.7312927246094
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	272.1175231933594
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	339.5052490234375
she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	161.703125
every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	123.59857177734375
it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."	215.0437469482422
from something that he told me in
our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him.	193.18394470214844
this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself."	370.44189453125
"you shall have it in few words.	681.1033935546875
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	203.3609161376953
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	2.7370657920837402
oh!	52.362361907958984
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	492.8288269042969
he readily agreed to it.	459.5380859375
i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."	173.01963806152344
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at pemberley.	70.23761749267578
but that
gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."	320.39422607421875
i saw them the night before last."	218.57679748535156
if _i_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."	53.568443298339844
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	721.8997802734375
replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	62.328285217285156
my
father, however, is partial to mr wickham.	949.6839599609375
but you know married women have never much time for
writing.	252.403564453125
i cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.	224.1932830810547
it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner.	145.00096130371094
the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	157.76841735839844
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	72.82384490966797
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	167.12522888183594
have all her friends left her?"	1170.3438720703125
he immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	109.9957046508789
i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	796.6725463867188
it must be an amusing study."	65.4456787109375
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	725.5740356445312
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	246.5842742919922
elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	229.18014526367188
*       *       *       *       *

mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	88.54022979736328
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	262.9573669433594
it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	290.60546875
miss lucas is married and settled.	186.45509338378906
a lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	427.6997985839844
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	83.64856719970703
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	250.9879608154297
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	75.7491226196289
he did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september, than any body else in the country.	6005.04052734375
that tall, proud man."	69.10609436035156
as long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	211.59364318847656
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	163.11697387695312
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	462.9472961425781
if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	373.218994140625
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr
bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	43.73665237426758
"no, i believe not."	228.56405639648438
"my object _then_," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	140.18702697753906
it was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.	968.141357421875
how strange must it appear to him!	802.2362670898438
he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	96.93733215332031
could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life
     saw him so affected.	1231.65576171875
we _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	43.0794677734375
repeated mr bennet.	85.10171508789062
mr bennet replied that he had not.	152.3236083984375
what is your own opinion?"	146.6878662109375
"no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."	66.18380737304688
i would go and see her, if i could have the
carriage."	649.2476806640625
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	226.16140747070312
i
never was.	101.99897766113281
in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	235.0021514892578
he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, i am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	140.82699584960938
"if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	78.85388946533203
"i do not get on at all.	49.743896484375
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr
bingley, if she could.	36.123077392578125
"your humility, mr bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	248.395263671875
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	97.3395767211914
we
shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some
balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all."	142.22886657714844
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought
only of _you_."	363.3243713378906
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	325.1357116699219
mr darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	118.2848892211914
he called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.	138.76206970214844
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning.	696.5225219726562
bingley urged mr jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	163.2002410888672
charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	165.17201232910156
lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	180.2516632080078
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	123.1153564453125
find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.'	391.6684265136719
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	179.06167602539062
the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	124.44739532470703
"for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her.	687.12158203125
_she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	65.34960174560547
in every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	822.7659301757812
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	59.06843948364258
will you come and see me?"	216.12435913085938
"mr darcy is not to be laughed at!"	168.1741485595703
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards mr wickham.	1951.8033447265625
the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	80.24462890625
she was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr darcy said very
little, and mr hurst nothing at all.	178.72430419921875
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	266.4968566894531
never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	134.4497833251953
but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	1236.1649169921875
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	124.36939239501953
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	347.2876892089844
had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	185.31053161621094
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	35.39060974121094
why did she come?	117.12644958496094
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr
darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	374.45361328125
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	709.6688232421875
i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	383.15826416015625
i declare i do not
know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."	60.44210433959961
and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment.	170.8791046142578
i will go directly to mr bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	203.74761962890625
she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	358.6242370605469
and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	166.2012176513672
about ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire, to which he belonged.	34.636600494384766
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	2660.870849609375
he knows where we live.	361.3016662597656
one seems so forlorn without them."	144.92506408691406
the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	293.23699951171875
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	133.87286376953125
it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	1253.598876953125
had colonel forster seen denny himself?"	40.81266403198242
it cannot be.	73.11724090576172
"oh!	206.22317504882812
"it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	198.57723999023438
"ten thousand pounds!	105.10362243652344
"i think she will.	50.92869567871094
that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr darcy!	973.4286499023438
in
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	315.207763671875
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	620.5191040039062
"and men take care that they should."	165.7811737060547
she declared her resolution.	89.36279296875
"true.	72.84284210205078
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or
rather taller."	61.99204635620117
"mr bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	204.3697052001953
"what should not you mind?"	174.01998901367188
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	32.14932632446289
"i cannot believe it.	94.52067565917969
he did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.	219.7493438720703
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure
you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."	228.7337188720703
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	490.7265930175781
i
     must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.	319.6507873535156
"she did indeed, louisa.	67.53217315673828
a
little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	221.44686889648438
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet.	81.16897583007812
"i cannot make him
out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	445.5943908691406
thoughtless and indiscreet i
     can easily believe him, but this step and let us rejoice over it
     marks nothing bad at heart.	74.06676483154297
he was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"just as you please."	127.9356918334961
she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	211.25592041015625
what a stroke was this for poor jane!	287.478759765625

oh, lizzy!	78.8895492553711
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	57.07089614868164
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	167.56947326660156
to these high
flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	200.54481506347656
had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	176.8579559326172
i only hope they may have half my
good luck.	81.93006896972656
"you cannot be too much on your guard.	636.2828369140625
in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	2.7370657920837402
oh!	175.9835662841797
into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	189.4232177734375
and
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	80.86651611328125
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_."	265.6354064941406
he came to tell mr gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia
     once.	229.10626220703125
and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	638.2644653320312
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	654.1448364257812
her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	178.2989501953125
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	160.46990966796875
they will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from
     mrs gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the south.	151.71961975097656
"and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."	124.30297088623047
i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	79.44268035888672
however, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	2178.62451171875
royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax
     returns.	137.14772033691406
"you have.	269.2856750488281
we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."	175.45828247070312
"yours, &c."

"well, my dear," said mr bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr bingley, and under your orders."	633.154541015625
every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	348.320556640625
he never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr
and mrs collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	314.9493713378906
lydia laughed, and said,

"aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	167.9644775390625
i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	86.17633819580078
"i certainly shall not.	139.60426330566406
you need not send them word at
     longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
     wickham.	232.97254943847656
had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"	71.6709976196289
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."	203.31690979003906
a carat character is used to denote superscription.	118.61604309082031
his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	67.8334732055664
they must all go to brighton.	281.472900390625
"how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say.--_you_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	45.27742004394531
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	574.016845703125
he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	305.6296081542969
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	246.14761352539062
"with my mother up stairs.	126.25004577636719
he has
     more to give.	110.87252807617188
she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	304.3975830078125
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	152.55482482910156
this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	228.48757934570312
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	361.8529052734375
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	437.9015197753906
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	73.96851348876953
who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	7.971529483795166
thank heaven!	58.01913833618164
"bingley."	1049.3702392578125
he did trace them easily to
     clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from epsom.	994.2337036132812
the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	291.89691162109375
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	83.2816162109375
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."	101.6635971069336
"no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension.	1300.46337890625
i will only add, god bless you.	204.06594848632812
from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	224.07272338867188
they were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	178.71986389160156
"only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away;
it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	114.84207916259766
he heard her with astonishment.	314.3495178222656
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss
bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	55.51951599121094
but let me advise you to think better of it.	180.5427703857422
"impossible, mr bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	123.88439178466797
they met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed.	45.296043395996094
he was well, but so much
engaged with mr darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	121.18148803710938
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	42.81642150878906
"upon my word," said mrs gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	180.91229248046875
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	129.811279296875
she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley.	957.6057739257812
well, much good may it do them!	351.58856201171875
her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	423.2676086425781
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	311.0364685058594
they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	1191.3067626953125
i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	676.8616943359375
elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	1021.5911865234375
if mr darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	51.70552062988281
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr
wickham and herself.	427.26397705078125
i dearly love a
laugh."	27.54144859313965
mr darcy bowed.	45.073123931884766
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	477.99554443359375
if he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	14.38329029083252
gardiner."	1704.1092529296875
a clear ten
thousand per annum.	129.1836700439453
whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr bennet were dead.	4223.71630859375
only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"	269.7764892578125
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	44.31074905395508
"it is a long time, mr bingley, since you went away," said mrs bennet.	177.69972229003906
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	115.90019226074219
it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	109.22504425048828
"no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose.	315.0218811035156
is not he a charming man?	49.20847702026367
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	87.93180084228516
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	3180.900146484375
donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	2.7370657920837402
oh!	229.04446411132812
"yes--the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	325.8749694824219
my
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of mr wickham.	662.2326049804688
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	166.39852905273438
in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	463.1279296875
mr
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn
family; jane heard them with horror.	703.4202270507812
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	283.8217468261719
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	210.9134063720703
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."	112.7326889038086
"i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	286.95367431640625
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	446.820556640625
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	857.5306396484375
he could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	438.9970397949219
their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	216.2562255859375
"he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling.	430.42333984375
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	176.9720001220703
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	142.6223602294922
"i had much rather go in the coach."	805.6842041015625
as she pronounced these words, mr darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	346.0485534667969
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!	154.2179412841797
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	257.66064453125
i was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth
     and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	56.52622604370117
"how could
you begin?"	136.33457946777344
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	303.17962646484375
she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of mr collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings.	195.09332275390625
the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	139.68223571777344
she could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	140.1522674560547
i appeal to mr darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	122.07154846191406
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	146.19125366210938
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	447.5244140625
my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	87.90052032470703
"you can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	175.62535095214844
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	480.3150329589844
such a countenance, such manners!	336.2411804199219
for what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"	189.6886749267578
lord bless me!	365.12139892578125
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	173.38204956054688
but though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	133.7807159423828
can it be really so!	363.2196044921875
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	139.48597717285156
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	179.6214599609375
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	333.0305480957031
at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	148.87472534179688
"i am sure there is not on _his_.	69.90162658691406
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	499.6077880859375
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.	183.06629943847656
in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to mrs collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	115.09183502197266
"you are quite right.	387.14154052734375
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	84.20820617675781
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	496.9379577636719
it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	168.788330078125
she answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"my eldest sister has been in town these three months.	181.43182373046875
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	123.7205810546875
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
pemberley.	493.54376220703125
sir william only smiled.	1184.5361328125
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	640.3135375976562
if you
do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the
rules is very easy.	183.01348876953125
"i have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	110.34184265136719
my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says.	313.7530212402344
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!	5134.3173828125
"she is my youngest girl but one.	59.27729034423828
i am ashamed of you!	239.47439575195312
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	302.6945495605469
she cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving wickham.	165.31478881835938
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	429.3096923828125
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.	556.982666015625
in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	238.54702758789062
elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	130.37646484375
"when i consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew
what he was.	90.03451538085938
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	1794.9825439453125
you give me
fresh life and vigour.	31.255672454833984
elizabeth was forced to go.	167.03990173339844
she tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr
darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	110.65541076660156
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"	96.9857406616211
"by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.	33.14513397216797
at present i will
say nothing about it."	1818.904296875
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	150.45489501953125
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	389.0221862792969
he resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.	332.7834167480469
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	112.82120513916016
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	221.17027282714844
elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	495.9656982421875
"fitzwilliam darcy."	121.6456298828125
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	58.48994064331055
if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	23.992938995361328
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	150.1038360595703
i dare say mr bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	205.3409423828125
she asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then
observed,

"your father's estate is entailed on mr collins, i think.	102.99571990966797
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	142.6414794921875
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."	42.272151947021484
"i should not mind any thing at all."	48.8708381652832
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	210.12767028808594
but, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	378.1108093261719
"yours, &c."

as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	389.5092468261719
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out.	1825.6324462890625
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	119.10051727294922
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by wickham.	376.70855712890625
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	13653.4775390625
come be quick, be quick!	389.28717041015625
"dear madam," cried mrs hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from mr gardiner?	104.01241302490234
i congratulate her.	135.69366455078125
the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	2086.384765625
"and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	215.26556396484375
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	192.11831665039062
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	375.5483093261719
she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	96.44548034667969
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	417.508544921875
she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but mrs bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	1826.2078857421875
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.	105.36334991455078
but i hope you will not mind it: it is
all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	3.4602057933807373
good bye."	85.96177673339844
"upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except netherfield.	324.47235107421875
she
could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	80.87075805664062
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	272.7575988769531
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.	346.86383056640625
i dare say the
lace upon mrs hurst's gown----"

here she was interrupted again.	97.5870361328125
he owns it
himself without disguise."	963.9302368164062
