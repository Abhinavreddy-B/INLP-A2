invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to
inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent

render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:

stephen: how is that?	44174.11328125
what rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate

but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way

and her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home.	4967.87744140625
she felt a kind of a

wagnerian music, though

follow at the first go-off but the music of mercadante’s _huguenots_,
meyerbeer’s _seven last words on the cross_ and mozart’s _twelfth mass_
he simply revelled in, the _gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the

noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti

asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she

fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was

meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of
sirius alpha in canis maior 10 lightyears 57,000,000,000,000 miles
distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of
arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of orion with belt and
sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could
be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules: of
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of
allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	0.0

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90

wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	9988.2021484375

it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
what it meant to rule the waves.	4517.08740234375

winding of his ticker.	5036.78271484375

their conversation accordingly
became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	4922.83251953125
breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk.	1091.9739990234375
that likes me well.	3638.960693359375

about us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets.	8344.29296875
he whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and
laughs kindly.	882.1364135742188
he heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	1970.471435546875
o, rocks!	4064.229248046875

so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
watchchain, looking up at the church.	1733.0345458984375

mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
private account while dublin slept.	329.87750244140625

mr dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at ned lambert’s quizzing

the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge
by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about

himself allowed matters to more or less.	2740.658935546875

the preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed
intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion
between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and
the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously
inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the
variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by
inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite
proposition parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic
transitive verb with direct feminine object from the active voice into
its correlative aorist preterite proposition parsed as feminine
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past
participle with complementary masculine agent in the passive voice:
the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual
production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest

adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
subsist otherwise under martian, mercurial, veneral, jovian, saturnian,
neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an
apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would

copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on

stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	5633.26806640625
influential friends.	35691.40234375
in vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through trinity gates.	1775.7733154296875
does
anybody really?	736.5810546875
that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as plato’s.	1495.35595703125
holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is
landed.	4490.9287109375
he provokes my intelligence.	220.2245330810547
he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	760.5807495117188
stephen: panting.	770.1934814453125

the lord
mayor was there, val dillon it was, and sir charles cameron and dan
dawson spoke and there was music.	754.975341796875
mrs breen: she did, of course, the cat!	1106.6517333984375
too much for me now.	2075.029296875
we’ll manure you, mr flower!	11270.8935546875
go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.	2178.80126953125
a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	1663.8177490234375
the fire brigade: pflaap!	9063.009765625

a most instructive discussion.	111.3082275390625
mrs cunningham: sings.	78.77204132080078

he went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
black church.	4200.02197265625
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	9248.6044921875
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	27.166296005249023
short but to the point


whose land?	566.4981079101562
if you.	206.87953186035156
o, that be damned for a story, mr dedalus said.	6629.1982421875

yearns this balmy summer eve.	262.7566833496094
stephen: he had three brothers, gilbert, edmund, richard.	1871.9324951171875

poor dignam!	8727.5810546875
let us go round by the chief’s grave, hynes said.	4047.73583984375
is it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been
prince hamlet’s twin, is it possible, i want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?	4016.783935546875
certainly, i
sort of believe strong in you, mr president.	479.8666076660156

during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	4585.45263671875
why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s

she often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant.	4600.37939453125

a stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by
daly’s window where a mermaid hair all streaming but he couldn’t see
blew whiffs of a mermaid blind couldn’t, mermaid, coolest whiff of

will someone tell me where i am least
likely to meet these necessary evils?	2432.756103515625
amused buck mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
selfnodding:

he halted near his daughter.	318.9870910644531

that’s in their
theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the

mr bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,
though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his
_protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in
the street which was still raging fast and furious:

at last they were
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips.	13057.9677734375

nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and
cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths
are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous
germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively
shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend
to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an
arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings
notably the maternal, is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long
run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival
of the fittest.	265.27276611328125

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
