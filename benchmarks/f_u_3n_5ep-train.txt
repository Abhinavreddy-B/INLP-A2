inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent

render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:

16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom’s present
age bloom would be 54. in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen
would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of
methusalah, 969 years, while, if stephen would continue to live until
he would attain that age in the year 3072 a.d., bloom would have been

of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing
immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case

crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,
drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a
domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord
and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would
overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes
though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as
quite possibly there were several others.	160.77894592285156

meyerbeer’s _seven last words on the cross_ and mozart’s _twelfth mass_

edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti
eis_ and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and
asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she
heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	35.421714782714844
nannan’s going too, says joe.	31.925914764404297
keep it a

says joe.	194.84947204589844

lenehan round the

quiet brute.	45.78995132446289
it’s the whole pie with jam in.	102.95540618896484
can’t read.	158.36126708984375
the ways of the creator are not our ways, mr deasy said.	18.83820343017578
he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:

what was their civilisation?	210.498046875
swell blowout.	148.21832275390625
are you not happy in
your?	123.58602142333984
a deathsman of the soul robert greene called him, stephen said.	110.96556091308594
he himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from
cobbler’s weak chest.	51.755828857421875
careless chap.	1742.4666748046875

see him grow up.	168.92478942871094
good idea if you’re stuck.	182.07020568847656
then her eyes rest on bloom
with hard insistence.	250.5310821533203

there is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the
city arms hotel.	273.9068603515625
think over it.	138.85287475585938
and mr?	80.05152130126953
one moment
he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and
the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol
expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	93.31440734863281
it’s not the wife anyhow, nosey flynn said.	143.88771057128906
moses and the promised land.	38.77739334106445
pawning his gold watch in cummins of francis street where
no-one would know him in the private office when i was there with
pisser releasing his boots out of the pop.	50.436824798583984
yes, mr bloom answered.	0.0

tea.	135.12353515625
he
pipes scoffingly.	129.60462951660156
he lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep
and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	242.09457397460938
not a vestige of truth in it, i can safely say.	123.66058349609375
you are falling.	180.60743713378906
came over last night.	674.157958984375
we are not in a
beargarden nor at an oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice.	73.84519958496094
whistles call and
answer.	132.50860595703125
as more than inevitable,
irreparable.	85.67937469482422
that’s the great empire they
boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	127.67546844482422
her ears ought to have tingled for a few
weeks after.	138.11607360839844
he
laughed low: a sizar’s laugh of trinity: unanswered.	257.07952880859375
good day, myles, j. j. o’molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
limply back on the file.	195.24354553222656
nicked myself shaving.	175.7510986328125
an instant later his head
appeared in the door opposite and said: meet me at westland row station
at ten past eleven.	152.71742248535156
she died, stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	149.92013549804688
ask the then captain, he
advised them, how much palmoil the british government gave him for that
day’s work, captain john lever of the lever line.	136.53091430664062
it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
born.	41.06410598754883
fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,
mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in hardwicke
street, that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told
me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on
her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	288.4797058105469
yes, sir, she said.	65.25447845458984
for this relief much thanks.	128.59022521972656
give it a name, citizen, says joe.	251.9186248779297
she must.	98.39971160888672
what would render such return irrational?	126.2060546875
there was every indication they would arrive at that, he, bloom, said.	124.05292510986328
keep that thing up for hours.	149.2071075439453
bello: changed, eh?	77.88565826416016
liverpool boat long gone.	163.79788208007812
stephen: kings and unicorns!	257.0628662109375
he followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away
among the pillars.	69.34375762939453
does he write anything for your movement?	139.42312622070312
bloom: murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.	92.16922760009766

all blows over.	288.332275390625
she is
dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with
tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like
minnie hauck in_ carmen.	97.41952514648438

behold the handmaid of the moon.	88.05989837646484
what was stephen’s auditive sensation?	136.27627563476562
bloom looked, unblessed to go.	354.82830810546875
he dwelt,
being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in
general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that
afternoon he had seen those grecian statues, perfectly developed as
works of art, in the national museum.	145.5995635986328
were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	23.913631439208984

stephen: break my spirit, will he?	124.78478240966797
the whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
powerhouse urged stephen to be on.	99.54470825195312

please tell me
what is the real meaning of that word?	128.40402221679688
he says this, a censor of morals, a very
pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of
nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn
from the lowest strata of society!	36.189453125
stephen: lamb of london, who takest away the sins of our world.	166.07952880859375
mr deasy asked.	213.8123779296875
mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that
lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed

postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was

1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules: of

evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes,
pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning

around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the

between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	374.18212890625

strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard, so

amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not

it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
what it meant to rule the waves.	188.3946075439453

mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the

for instance when the
evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely
in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	86.54654693603516

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
