waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to
render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:
the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the
admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,
when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	15603.486328125

16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom’s present
age bloom would be 54. in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen
would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of
methusalah, 969 years, while, if stephen would continue to live until
he would attain that age in the year 3072 a.d., bloom would have been
obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have

a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage
of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a
party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of

after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with
the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched, inflicted
fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was
reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of
fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	1546.4732666015625

the various colours significant of various degrees of vitality white,
yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar: their degrees of brilliancy:
their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:
the waggoner’s star: walsingham way: the chariot of david: the annular
cinctures of saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the
interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous
discoveries of galileo, simon marius, piazzi, le verrier, herschel,
galle: the systematisations attempted by bode and kepler of cubes of
distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite
compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive
and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin
of meteoric stones: the libyan floods on mars about the period of the
birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric
showers about the period of the feast of s. lawrence martyr, 10
august: the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon
in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the
appearance of a star 1st magnitude of exceeding brilliancy dominating
by night and day a new luminous sun generated by the collision and
amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns about the
period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent
neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star 2nd magnitude
of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and
disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about
the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of
presumably similar origin which had effectively or presumably
appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about
the period of the birth of stephen dedalus, and in and from the
constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph
bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before
or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena
of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of
wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of
nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light,
obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	2680.282958984375

production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the

1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules: of

evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote

that it was a utopia, there being no known method from the
known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and

buck mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
gravely said, honeying malice:

i called upon the bard kinch at his summer residence in upper
mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _summa
contra gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, fresh nelly
and rosalie, the coalquay whore.	12951.9755859375

they
lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	7635.49609375
buck mulligan suspired amorously.	5854.73974609375
i am a respectable

stink
gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens.	1704.313232421875
after you is good manners.	12576.0732421875
dream he had, a nightmare.	652.5731201171875
so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he, trying to
muck out of it:

the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings
they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy, boody and
katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes,
pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning

the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born 1820, acceded
1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke
and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru
imaginary: thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand
lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street:
fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverist’s
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverist’s revelations of white
articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
while she nelly bouverist was in the articles: fifthly, the
difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
allusions from _everybody’s book of jokes_ 1000 pages and a laugh in
every one: sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,

best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the
sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	9921.56640625

nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely
permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of
the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age

of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as

subsist otherwise under martian, mercurial, veneral, jovian, saturnian,
neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an
apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite

copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	6519.24951171875

resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in

his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:

ulysses


by james joyce

stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	7699.7646484375
influential friends.	42454.81640625
in vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through trinity gates.	2748.74072265625
does
anybody really?	6986.46728515625
that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as plato’s.	668.7068481445312
holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is
landed.	6691.349609375
he provokes my intelligence.	264.6148376464844
he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	2877.46337890625
stephen: panting.	1348.0960693359375
doran lyons in conway’s.	1062.0284423828125

children
always want to throw things in the sea.	44481.78515625
avoid.	1345.126953125
the lord
mayor was there, val dillon it was, and sir charles cameron and dan
dawson spoke and there was music.	2137.191162109375
mrs breen: she did, of course, the cat!	834.7380981445312
too much for me now.	9133.8134765625
we’ll manure you, mr flower!	16688.736328125
go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.	18812.28125
a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	6511.02978515625
the fire brigade: pflaap!	26207.439453125
catch them once with
their pants down.	2981.941650390625
the colours were done something lovely.	6206.51904296875
mrs yelverton barry: shame on him!	580.337158203125
a most instructive discussion.	121.60596466064453
mrs cunningham: sings.	71.02022552490234
we’re the same.	186.83306884765625
to zoe.	7468.33544921875
he boomed.	5056.22119140625
he went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
black church.	13895.2041015625
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	9403.0419921875
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	6.628495693206787
short but to the point


whose land?	1636.0087890625
if you.	539.1099243164062
o, that be damned for a story, mr dedalus said.	15732.7509765625
the best death, mr bloom said.	5409.85107421875
for such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve.	240.1281280517578
stephen: he had three brothers, gilbert, edmund, richard.	2943.251708984375
paddy leonard asked.	2322.7373046875
i’m a long time threatening to buy one.	604.059814453125
astronomy it was about.	203.82147216796875
are you off?	1911.2857666015625
poor dignam!	23214.03125
let us go round by the chief’s grave, hynes said.	7279.88916015625
is it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been
prince hamlet’s twin, is it possible, i want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?	9087.4951171875
certainly, i
sort of believe strong in you, mr president.	281.23931884765625
is that boylan well off?	94.31182098388672
jesus, mr doyle.	232.977294921875

because
he closed my carriage door outside sir thornley stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	16290.42578125
why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s
daughter?	646.8297119140625

he doesn’t chat.	1009.290771484375
no, mr bloom said, the son himself.	1435.02099609375

she often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant.	26160.818359375
for the
rest there is that english invention, pamphlet of which i received some
days ago, incorrectly addressed.	43447.0546875
a stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by
daly’s window where a mermaid hair all streaming but he couldn’t see
blew whiffs of a mermaid blind couldn’t, mermaid, coolest whiff of
all.	15829.6884765625
will someone tell me where i am least
likely to meet these necessary evils?	5305.0478515625
amused buck mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
selfnodding:

a pleased bottom.	1614.595703125
i thought we
were bad here.	21869.626953125
he halted near his daughter.	543.762451171875
the harp
that once did starve us all.	4333.7744140625
i didn’t recognise him for the moment.	2020.330078125
don’t you think his face is like our saviour?	3149.810546875

my dear simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	162.88279724121094
the mother: wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.	26.10053253173828
o, father dineen!	5500.46533203125
i’ll go.	5130.2646484375
the face of martin cunningham, bearded, refeatures shakespeare’s
beardless face.	2851.740234375
_tableau!_
that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that
to witness.	0.0

we’re on the right lay,
bob, believe you me.	8539.37109375
over their voices dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding
chords:

_when love absorbs my ardent soul_.	175.37338256835938
he has revealed it
in the sonnets where there is will in overplus.	2055.33544921875
that’s all right.	1985.799072265625
of a different order of difficulty.	14540.9970703125
that’s in their
theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the
absolution.	226.00714111328125
mr bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,
though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his
_protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in
the street which was still raging fast and furious:

a beautiful language.	17466.29296875
yes, he does.	9714.3115234375
so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
hear him lapping it up a mile off.	648.4912109375
and a third, stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	16954.392578125
is that a fact?	18453.240234375
bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration.	4139.6572265625
slowly, note by
note, oriental music is played.	3180.851318359375
he
scarcely looks thirtyone.	696.031494140625
his breath, birdsweet, good teeth

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
