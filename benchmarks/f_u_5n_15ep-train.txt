16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom’s present
age bloom would be 54. in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen
would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of
methusalah, 969 years, while, if stephen would continue to live until

of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing
immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case

crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,
drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a
domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord
and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would
overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes
though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as
quite possibly there were several others.	87.29212188720703

mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in hardwicke
street, that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told
me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on
her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	88.88274383544922

he dwelt,
being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in

the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched, inflicted
fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was

in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the
appearance of a star 1st magnitude of exceeding brilliancy dominating
by night and day a new luminous sun generated by the collision and
amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns about the
period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent
neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star 2nd magnitude
of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and
disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about
the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of
presumably similar origin which had effectively or presumably
appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about
the period of the birth of stephen dedalus, and in and from the
constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph
bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before
or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena
of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of

be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules: of
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of
allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	0.0

the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the
junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the

cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings

katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine
% marshes,
pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning
moon.	92.13019561767578

the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born 1820, acceded
1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:
secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the
questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke
and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru
imaginary: thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and
professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand
lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street:
fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverist’s
non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance
and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverist’s revelations of white
articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing
while she nelly bouverist was in the articles: fifthly, the
difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous
allusions from _everybody’s book of jokes_ 1000 pages and a laugh in
every one: sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous,

it was like the

he personally, being of a
sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about
saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging
around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the
sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_

breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little

mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own

the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of

in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	35.42545700073242

lady dudley was walking home
through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that
cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of dublin.	76.00750732421875
he closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and

mr bloom walked towards dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth

resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in
preparation for the impact of the fall.	14.93231201171875

his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:

ulysses


by james joyce

stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	24.70037269592285
influential friends.	28.757095336914062
in vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through trinity gates.	17.057077407836914
does
anybody really?	21.3802547454834
that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as plato’s.	158.6216278076172
holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is
landed.	110.66912841796875
he provokes my intelligence.	91.16090393066406
he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	22.973451614379883
stephen: panting.	71.85448455810547

the lord
mayor was there, val dillon it was, and sir charles cameron and dan
dawson spoke and there was music.	36.03934860229492
mrs breen: she did, of course, the cat!	33.37923812866211

go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.	11.386667251586914
a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	43.506107330322266
the fire brigade: pflaap!	1073.7861328125

the colours were done something lovely.	33.71329879760742
mrs yelverton barry: shame on him!	145.1004180908203
a most instructive discussion.	21.7664852142334
mrs cunningham: sings.	302.7138977050781

to zoe.	43.94147491455078
he boomed.	36.079444885253906
he went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
black church.	50.4301643371582
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	261.87200927734375
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	29.10360336303711
short but to the point


whose land?	25.36363410949707

poor dignam!	49.11354064941406
let us go round by the chief’s grave, hynes said.	106.19499969482422
is it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been
prince hamlet’s twin, is it possible, i want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?	322.0973205566406
certainly, i
sort of believe strong in you, mr president.	13.632039070129395

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
