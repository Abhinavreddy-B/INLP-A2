43.90460968017578
her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered?	44.06285095214844
"indeed!"	22.097679138183594
miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	32.37277603149414
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	51.90992736816406
"i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	28.413476943969727
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	38.816314697265625
i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading!	37.10565948486328
to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.	44.641754150390625
resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i
trust i am resigned.	35.7914924621582
i am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	81.53185272216797
does your
charge give you much trouble?	31.26430320739746
"i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth.	92.42757415771484
"i beg your pardon.	8.96471118927002
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	66.07479858398438
"oh, yes!	69.59959411621094
it only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	27.177284240722656
he studies too much for
words of four syllables.--do not you, darcy?"	76.36734008789062
they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	62.79166793823242
miss
bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	45.43682861328125
i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	44.58814239501953
oh, sister!	51.624454498291016
kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do.	58.50675964355469
"it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."	42.74673843383789
"if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	40.097938537597656
she shook her head.	8.362034797668457
in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the
minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	52.41718292236328
bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	26.472604751586914
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	33.05857467651367
"this is
wholly unexpected.	47.664947509765625
"gracechurch-street, monday,

     august 2.	36.51741409301758
she answered him with cold civility.	51.56878662109375
but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."	67.20021057128906
at present we
have nothing to guide us.	40.77067184448242
his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.	50.70498275756836
"my dear mr bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last?"	28.294658660888672
mr
collins then returned to elizabeth.	18.507591247558594
make
haste, and come down this moment."	60.653995513916016
but he found, in reply to
     this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	45.388492584228516
dear me!	32.46355056762695
allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."	39.17212677001953
i hope she will turn out well."	18.864572525024414
of course, we hope that you will support the project
gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.	49.697330474853516
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master.	41.28164291381836
it was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.	37.57479476928711
mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	25.314620971679688
she looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest mary should be singing all night.	124.17709350585938
have you had any
flirting?	35.275108337402344
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	20.89995574951172
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has
too much truth.	43.20302963256836
when all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish.	35.749019622802734
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	43.43003845214844
but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	39.19038009643555
consider how important every moment is, in such a case."	51.03314208984375
my father and mother believe the worst,
     but i cannot think so ill of him.	50.743927001953125
"how abominable!--i wonder that the very
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty i must call it."	42.11556625366211
there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.	43.25783157348633
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	39.511016845703125
well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley.--but--good
lord!	33.051246643066406
my aunt philips came to longbourn
on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me.	50.001861572265625
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede.	31.438112258911133
miss darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	52.396339416503906
the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	70.12837982177734
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	53.27903747558594
"and _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london!	52.44396209716797
all was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	22.907466888427734
my dear charles, what do you mean?"	48.73094940185547
nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight.	44.054534912109375
what i have to say relates to
     poor lydia.	15.653757095336914
he does not
want abilities.	49.62225341796875
"you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	44.50652313232422
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	36.55671310424805
her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	47.32211685180664
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let mr collins and me have a little conversation together."	52.472862243652344
stay, stay, i will go myself.	43.5777473449707
"ah!	56.426822662353516
"and how impossible in others!"	59.026824951171875
it must be my uncle's doings!	51.077003479003906
with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	24.50486946105957
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy."	39.81377410888672
he had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--but bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point.	63.036834716796875
"i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing.	22.88646125793457
i am
perfectly satisfied.	39.365562438964844
he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	80.53358459472656
1.e.	51.798179626464844
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	27.040424346923828
his principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.	52.06348419189453
their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	50.33652114868164
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."	24.034042358398438
"dining out," said mrs bennet, "that is very unlucky."	39.76664352416992
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	39.25959396362305
it was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	22.13420295715332
yes--i understand you perfectly."	80.53358459472656
1.e.5.	46.44441604614258
yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.	14.604183197021484
with _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."	33.10993957519531
"yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word."	28.744873046875
"well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	23.858808517456055
you alluded to something else.	25.626453399658203
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	57.908058166503906
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	39.5990104675293
"no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	58.50737762451172
he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	12.786975860595703
_she_ will not be able to help calling."	58.89636993408203
nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure and i do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it, your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	30.643964767456055
she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	56.90041732788086
she replied in the affirmative.	42.19419860839844
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	37.24674987792969
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."	32.624244689941406
she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	52.9352912902832
"i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	33.38933181762695
the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	73.02608489990234
well, monday morning came, and i was in
such a fuss!	37.45106506347656
it was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr darcy!	71.81549072265625
"has she been presented?	35.036102294921875
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	36.57611083984375
the others have been gone on to scarborough,
these three weeks."	23.29030418395996
shocking!"	33.23570251464844
so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	109.94332122802734
are the others coming out?"	71.41769409179688
"a place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	53.6074104309082
we all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	48.15571975708008
mr darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.	35.12904357910156
darcy was fixed in astonishment.	42.917938232421875
"it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	67.90419006347656
she will be taken good care of.	23.773578643798828
lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	46.3495979309082
to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what jane felt for bingley.	28.438907623291016
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	28.94819450378418
they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either."	42.20427703857422
"about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i
answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	50.09672927856445
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?	31.19142723083496
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it."	60.32785415649414
"it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	38.23914337158203
mr bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has
received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	34.59577941894531
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	51.0075569152832
"and i have another favour to ask.	44.109806060791016
your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."	35.06678009033203
young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	41.243202209472656
how he lived i know not.	20.863998413085938
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	50.49591064453125
though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was."	89.61006164550781
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	38.13370132446289
in the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
elizabeth, said,

"miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."	20.316789627075195
tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."	34.62562561035156
it will pass away soon enough."	38.22185134887695
widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she
deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	32.033164978027344
what could she mean by
it?	24.03019142150879
what shall we do with him?	34.53889083862305
she then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,

"come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	30.59638023376465
we had better go into the
avenue."	39.47103500366211
the
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	118.51377868652344
you see on
what a footing we are.	27.689176559448242
ever since i have known it, i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it.	24.505266189575195
i am impatient to see him."	46.983497619628906
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before.	35.499244689941406
i cannot think of it without abhorrence."	48.90039825439453
she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be.	73.11724090576172
"oh!	50.61471176147461
the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."	24.352609634399414
i will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn."	14.78873348236084
cried mrs gardiner.	41.405399322509766
i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	33.76863479614258
the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.	67.9750747680664
i often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.	28.196348190307617
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	41.789615631103516
if the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.	40.64148712158203
"miss elizabeth bennet!"	31.864910125732422
mr bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at netherfield house.	33.368019104003906
georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	38.45155334472656
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	35.65704345703125
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	23.649768829345703
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	46.501548767089844
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	42.44950485229492
there was
another reason too for her opposition.	52.72223663330078
girls, can i do any
thing for you in meryton?	44.52216339111328
every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch.	31.601516723632812
"as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent
four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable."	49.71868896484375
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while mr darcy was attending them to their
carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	29.639930725097656
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	15.793322563171387
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	29.63738441467285
"yes, madam," said mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.	36.481590270996094
"we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	40.725467681884766
"while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--i
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	26.714635848999023
they will
ruin your happiness.	48.41911697387695
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	14.60485553741455
lady catherine seemed pleased.	30.095504760742188
my dear lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us.	42.7579460144043
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner
thought of him, and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	24.722347259521484
i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	16.500871658325195
every thing
that is charming!	56.155216217041016
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	60.05046081542969
"it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	50.91572189331055
"i have already told her so once, by your desire."	12.428498268127441

"it did.	45.15019607543945
my brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	59.613128662109375
your daughter
elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."	27.636993408203125
lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."	41.506561279296875
his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	49.288875579833984
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	45.880924224853516
"very well.	73.11724090576172
"oh!	31.238313674926758
the feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."	68.14983367919922
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.	38.855438232421875
elizabeth looked surprised.	19.093496322631836
said he, smiling.	55.2624397277832
"do not you want to know who has taken it?"	32.506500244140625
a single man of large fortune; four

"what sort of a girl is miss darcy?"	37.660491943359375
i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."	24.923662185668945
"you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir."	66.74004364013672
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	64.04557800292969
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	33.514835357666016
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--mr bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.	60.2873649597168
"and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!	28.038862228393555

did you admire me for my impertinence?"	35.37539291381836

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

the very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	26.790014266967773
"you mistake me, my dear.	44.564453125
"not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."	14.14183235168457
"ah!"	38.8622932434082
the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	31.59116554260254
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."	50.29022216796875
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	20.756813049316406
it was all conjecture."	32.597721099853516
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his
wife?"	21.1751708984375
"mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	35.499202728271484
"for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."	34.957149505615234
for a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	37.35961151123047
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.	22.4619140625
mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	35.77182388305664
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
netherfield.	31.86185073852539
mr denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, mr wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	42.54783248901367
though i
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
you."	44.96637725830078
i cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	38.88531494140625
on their being joined by mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	47.906009674072266
"come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	38.03741455078125
my reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	45.483238220214844
miss bingley was
engrossed by mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	51.43280029296875
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."	44.97452926635742
"there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel
fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in london.	32.94443893432617
"that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	40.34444046020508
"my dear mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	41.400611877441406
her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	15.618025779724121

"it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire.	90.94962310791016
the business was therefore soon settled.	29.354888916015625
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	30.69127082824707
his
attachment to rosings, certainly increases."	57.7744255065918
their reception at home was most kind.	38.60919952392578
"lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent.	35.69558334350586
it was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.	74.71994018554688
bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	35.858272552490234
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	40.34828567504883
but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be
     indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--these causes
     must be stated, though briefly.--the situation of your mother's
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you.	51.33021926879883
it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	32.38337707519531
you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	45.311241149902344
her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	34.732242584228516
"mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library."	56.07518005371094
"mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.	46.058719635009766
said her mother.	40.39340591430664
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	33.76887130737305
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.	34.07017517089844
then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	31.492874145507812
and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen pemberley."	42.192039489746094
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	50.62853240966797
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	41.009796142578125
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	46.37113952636719
but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could."	22.18230438232422
pray read on."	59.93860626220703
her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	42.02576446533203
they attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas.	42.72123336791992
his debts are to be paid,
     amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased.	39.950843811035156
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	48.454593658447266
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be
dissuaded from it.	14.69179630279541
i mend
pens remarkably well."	34.17039108276367
she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."	67.37298583984375
now what have you to say?"	41.86399841308594
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect.	48.43970489501953
when the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	35.07558822631836
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?"	43.014892578125
i am so happy.	46.34291076660156
after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "i _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	42.02403259277344
"do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	41.69021987915039
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	41.36296081542969
my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady
catherine.	24.376068115234375
_he_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."	12.094608306884766
elizabeth silently attended
her.	29.749454498291016
"true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	31.776762008666992
what will you think of my vanity?	34.760162353515625
she wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	57.615821838378906
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	18.44085693359375

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.	95.37672424316406
and what sort of table do they keep?	37.29050827026367
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	32.140655517578125
no one made any reply.	41.690975189208984
"i have no right to give _my_ opinion," said wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	50.734439849853516
i will take care of
myself, and of mr wickham too.	49.88386154174805
she has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall i call it?	27.286880493164062
said mr gardiner.	57.051910400390625
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	40.049861907958984
it is what every body says.	34.559364318847656
"yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	33.57435989379883
their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	52.07485580444336
he replied, and was again silent.	13.288976669311523
her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."	25.2814884185791
a small sum could not do all this."	24.031496047973633
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	40.73953628540039
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	35.68684768676758
mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	26.819730758666992
on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	31.101558685302734
"don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake!	67.79952239990234
but my dear lydia, i don't
at all like your going such a way off.	37.25899887084961
as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, mr darcy, and mr
darcy only, entered the room.	23.24431037902832
there was also a postscript to this
effect.	32.26689529418945
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady
catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."	31.07132339477539
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	36.938385009765625
"a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	44.16505432128906
"but not before they went to brighton?"	41.21773147583008
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	52.34823226928711
"perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	43.09593963623047
she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	19.35785675048828
that he has neither integrity nor honour.	29.594125747680664
"but the wife of mr
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause

"perhaps i do.	29.200090408325195
in the hall they parted.	39.55352783203125
is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	28.733491897583008
his brother-in-law, mr hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	44.166507720947266
jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	71.10504150390625
"there has
been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way.	80.3116226196289
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	45.55305099487305
catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.	81.75695037841797
are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	13.781643867492676
was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	47.829833984375
my
watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.	28.19964599609375
we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.	53.72545623779297
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	38.77115249633789
however, if you provide access to or

as it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	57.23744583129883
"are you not diverted?"	36.2639045715332
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?"	37.393943786621094
said mrs bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	12.957380294799805
i am most seriously displeased."	40.16014862060547
"next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky."	61.407249450683594
the power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	37.87174606323242
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"you are mistaken, mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."	21.47478675842285
"yes, she will remain there till christmas."	48.5481071472168
some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening.	56.40310287475586
at last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	55.31395721435547
"she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property."	61.083091735839844
it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	53.65074157714844
"certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am
not one of _them_.	38.88547134399414
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	48.01447677612305
howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined
     by mrs collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter,
     to whom i have related the affair.	34.069454193115234
i depend on you for that."	31.359088897705078
after a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	46.302520751953125
i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother
lady catherine.	63.61463165283203
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.	37.148067474365234
she has two nieces
of her own.	38.56862258911133
lydia came to
     us; and wickham had constant admission to the house.	46.91339874267578
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday.	30.286914825439453
well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	64.41850280761719
i always said it must be so, at last.	36.228145599365234
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	59.7398681640625
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"	59.36231994628906
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.	57.23171615600586
"an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth.	33.71564483642578
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	37.911258697509766
why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"	49.06080627441406
i wish i could see her.	50.2808837890625
it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	34.08537673950195
respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.	62.661983489990234
"_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza," said
charlotte.	24.027965545654297
i am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.	38.394161224365234
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	21.64956283569336
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.	45.49293518066406
the motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him.	27.73420524597168
we have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."	38.405174255371094
"you forget that i have made no
answer.	47.76436233520508
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	46.03473663330078
"but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	37.31932067871094
"no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise."	59.61116409301758
who
are your uncles and aunts?	27.949159622192383
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.	68.97526550292969
"i do not know.	100.37105560302734
and poor mr darcy!	62.94449996948242
such
doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly.	57.62404251098633
the loo table, however, did not appear.	22.78476333618164
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	35.327796936035156
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	64.40128326416016
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!	42.1193962097168
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	40.20794677734375
when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	39.125423431396484
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	55.854652404785156
he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	58.74227523803711
"i desire you will do no such thing.	35.49360656738281
they may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."	47.26848220825195
"i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	84.41352081298828
"what, has she frightened away
some of your lovers?	38.64822769165039
and when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "i shall insist on their giving one also.	49.07595443725586
she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters.	42.84944152832031
miss
bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?	61.500553131103516
would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	54.62713623046875
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	42.43388366699219
her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	42.23246765136719
in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	37.026981353759766
it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in."	37.67001724243164
"did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	41.27814865112305
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."	39.465267181396484
every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	10.373501777648926
james's?"	19.37687873840332
i hope we
may often meet again."	35.60319519042969
after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, mr collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.	37.1927604675293
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	27.112062454223633
_your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.	35.73103713989258
our distress, my
     dear lizzy, is very great.	46.15684509277344
i thought i should have died.	47.935970306396484
many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i
despair.	28.374237060546875
"his father was an excellent man," said mrs gardiner.	37.05936813354492
"but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."	30.655132293701172
mr darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	58.53304672241211
the apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	29.22930145263672
it is admirable!"	44.386722564697266
lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	26.60105323791504
her colour
changed, and she said no more.	28.124940872192383
it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	28.71751594543457

the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	40.275386810302734
are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?	49.78037643432617
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	120.10723114013672
i am very, very sorry.	41.28517532348633

"when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."	59.53001403808594
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	39.894371032714844
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time.	42.986412048339844
"he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"	46.011329650878906
she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	45.42207717895508
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	62.513328552246094
"i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about mr wickham.	52.89179229736328
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	38.004329681396484
the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street.	64.66649627685547
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	31.220378875732422
for my part, i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.	56.821922302246094
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.	18.460355758666992
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	5.64966344833374
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."	33.088134765625
here comes hill.	64.96304321289062
in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.	30.74549674987793
it mortifies me.	35.2337532043457
mr collins and charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	40.506465911865234
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him.	28.07664680480957
with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr wickham and the
officers, mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	23.160844802856445
the reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	47.79453659057617
scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	40.312747955322266
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	48.10087203979492
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would
     write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	32.45588684082031
"shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to
befall her?"	24.784337997436523
i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."	17.0933780670166
yes, i call it a _very_ easy distance."	37.20923614501953
you have no compassion on my poor nerves."	46.89366912841797
she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged mr collins's conversation to herself.	44.75102233886719
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.	40.01321029663086
the
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was elizabeth's intimate friend.	80.88047790527344
you will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	40.28709030151367
"_that_ you certainly shall."	53.803855895996094
from his garden, mr collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	72.75703430175781
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."	61.12353515625
but will they make you happy?"	27.47552490234375
you must and shall be married by a special licence.	44.71806716918945
say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.	23.580223083496094
"when is your next ball to be, lizzy?"	39.12114715576172
i defy even sir william lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	40.8680419921875
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs
bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly."	68.95596313476562
the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	16.80890464782715
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help.	19.708091735839844
she
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	25.80561637878418
to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	34.873504638671875
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	40.22987365722656
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.	45.03178024291992
where, where is my uncle?"	46.77846145629883
but the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."	36.87890625
we know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	31.811689376831055
pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	34.8614387512207
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty.	38.943084716796875
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	49.8387336730957
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	59.05756759643555
unfortunately an only son, for many years an only _child_
i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable, allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	28.072694778442383
mr bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	57.19210433959961
you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them."	38.35077667236328
"not yet," replied jane.	55.871639251708984
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	38.319000244140625
all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	40.13646697998047
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
that you should come together.	56.05392837524414
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	35.149959564208984
she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	30.049665451049805
but
my dearest love, tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of,
that i may have it to-morrow."	34.296260833740234
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	28.321836471557617
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	31.009946823120117
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the
     address specified in section 4, "information about donations to
     the project gutenberg literary archive foundation."	28.65294647216797
let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	42.30160140991211
she will
make him a very proper wife."	33.924888610839844
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	41.154808044433594
"mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling.	45.18683624267578
it cannot be concealed from any one.	25.762310028076172
when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	28.449264526367188
"if you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	43.83835983276367
i hate such false
friends.	50.548431396484375
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.	56.785491943359375
here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	51.35906982421875
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	36.74295425415039
"poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!	44.60439682006836
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	16.923559188842773
but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet.	39.06368637084961
there was no want of discourse.	42.81863784790039
its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	47.30328369140625
"is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?"	47.02130889892578
"could i expect it to be otherwise!"	90.19771575927734
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	46.8963623046875
"indeed i have, sir," was her answer.	25.76074981689453
"and have you answered the letter?"	64.4593734741211
i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	42.71855545043945
he
arranges the business just as he pleases."	33.90517044067383
but he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not.	69.82777404785156
"but i was embarrassed."	39.0616455078125
"my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	47.198604583740234
"but depend upon it, mr collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be
brought to reason.	43.35041046142578
had she not seen him in
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	38.5133171081543
their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	22.34415626525879
i shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance i require."	62.202781677246094
"these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth.	33.5367546081543
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."	38.60697937011719
"_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it."	41.619510650634766
i do not know the
particulars, but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	47.1981315612793
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can
assure you, he informed me himself."	44.28236389160156
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.	44.198036193847656
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	18.855758666992188
i shall be back by dinner."	47.19132614135742
_that_ is all settled."	38.45267868041992
instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them."	30.420246124267578
but as to your
other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.	78.19622802734375
mr philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.	55.778289794921875
she answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	22.546283721923828
he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.	44.8608512878418
"yes; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	37.629024505615234
brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton."	52.0897331237793
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	38.851951599121094
an union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	45.852352142333984
yes--it would be much better to
wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again.	20.16594886779785
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	44.01301193237305
where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	41.80839157104492
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"engaged to mr collins!	44.808204650878906
her ladyship was highly incensed.	32.54446029663086
as
for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	42.55919647216797
what
     he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again
     to-morrow evening.	85.86013793945312
it is mr wickham's intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	39.2447509765625
"my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	52.46257781982422
"you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	57.36906433105469
"when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--oh!	38.23408508300781
they agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family.	42.28993225097656
"i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter!"	39.93258285522461
"my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"	43.14665222167969
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	22.537174224853516
copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.	34.9310188293457
how unlucky!	34.77113342285156
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings.	32.84542465209961
she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	38.26202392578125
i am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr darcy's
regard."	34.52961730957031
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	43.626834869384766
bromley, of course.--if you mention my name at the bell,
you will be attended to."	52.236881256103516
i did not know before, that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	79.24927520751953
is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	18.33638572692871
"my motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	34.18623352050781
"take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	42.287967681884766
mr wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr collins for
a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.	32.20664978027344
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."	79.4393081665039
after tea, mr bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument.	37.03752517700195
what say you,
mary?	49.41426467895508
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."	29.78227996826172
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire.	53.887264251708984
"it is more than i engage for, i assure you."	57.503238677978516
they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	42.17334747314453
said her aunt.	23.589982986450195
they are not married,
     nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
     your side, i hope it will not be long before they are.	36.589141845703125
consider mr collins's respectability, and
charlotte's prudent, steady character.	48.64187240600586
"your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	46.566829681396484
having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	30.895597457885742
they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs
bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what elizabeth felt.	44.879634857177734
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."	30.697338104248047
in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	50.516902923583984
it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	49.56425857543945
mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	35.613765716552734
"you may as well call it impertinence at once.	69.84525299072266
had i known what
i ought, what i dared, to do!	47.56470489501953
he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	32.96316146850586
"you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	50.01638412475586
she had been unwilling to
mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.	70.08458709716797
his fear of her, has always operated, i
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he
has very much at heart."	43.93409729003906
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	46.189395904541016
mrs bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	32.93065643310547
young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."	29.99643898010254
long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	45.80665969848633
"you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	42.097930908203125
"and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	53.6566047668457
but, lizzy!	18.32661247253418
he had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other
     person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions.	39.537681579589844
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	35.3842658996582
many small donations
$1 to $5,000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.	39.83286666870117
her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	44.57807540893555
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	64.4468002319336
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	35.87696838378906
she
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	22.715576171875
mr gardiner declared his
willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	15.830719947814941
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.	23.981199264526367
cried elizabeth.	32.1463508605957
"no governess!	29.7521915435791
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when mr denny comes back from town."	40.388648986816406
on the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	48.156211853027344
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.	27.1705322265625
"dear lizzy!"	56.266204833984375
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	40.54452133178711
but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--mr bingley will not be detained in london by
them."	24.292448043823242
and as i come back, i can call on
lady lucas and mrs long.	10.346020698547363
if an individual project gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder, the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees
or charges.	36.85795974731445
it is nearly fifty miles."	35.81118392944336
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	13.49365234375
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty.	2.8924403190612793
mr bennet treated the matter differently.	38.6990966796875
lord!	73.237060546875
i never saw such a long chin in my life.	33.58002853393555
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	42.871734619140625
what a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"	59.9929084777832
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."	25.675907135009766
is she handsome?"	56.843711853027344
the foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united
states.	47.067508697509766
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	39.85459899902344
it gives me pain
to speak ill of a darcy.	36.650421142578125
charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.	73.11724090576172
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy."	95.2273941040039
"oh!	34.327796936035156
and now here's mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight
wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	95.15840148925781
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	51.6836051940918
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too!	19.999879837036133
and when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	52.46472930908203
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	35.725032806396484
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	38.1976203918457
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	57.2830696105957
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	54.113216400146484
"my dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	47.60791015625
he scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	51.2391357421875
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.	43.93682098388672
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	30.643936157226562
unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	75.20355224609375
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	50.53007888793945
i promised
them so faithfully!	45.838951110839844
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"	71.16535186767578
"nothing child, nothing.	59.85426712036133
the first week of their return was soon gone.	38.43332290649414
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	31.88431739807129
in short,
i will do my best."	34.21566390991211
but our visitor
     was very obstinate.	46.633949279785156
to
put me on my guard?	36.435302734375
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	45.5849609375
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	43.93124771118164
"what is mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?	66.10869598388672
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr denny had
brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	38.479068756103516
at such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	31.083072662353516
she
had ventured only one glance at darcy.	33.607940673828125
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which i have never acknowledged.	26.59283447265625
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	49.481075286865234
i will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."	64.87556457519531
"that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	26.946462631225586
"come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance.	31.840051651000977
she was gone directly.	43.72663497924805
i am
going away myself."	69.45435333251953
"certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	33.09670639038086
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	42.720123291015625
even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and
monday, endurable to kitty and lydia.	69.58808135986328
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do.	39.859012603759766
how are you all?"	31.524648666381836
"miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	31.167448043823242
the officers will find
women better worth their notice.	49.4436149597168
lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	38.65828323364258
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	33.76631546020508
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated
elopement.	41.77106857299805
bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	70.09809112548828
they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

"come, mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	83.7411117553711
"no, not at all."	47.99237060546875
i should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.	37.72586441040039
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	43.3913688659668
"i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	89.6670913696289
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	20.310306549072266
had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	45.639137268066406
i want to talk very seriously.	52.5120849609375
and his sisters are charming women.	64.24286651611328
"the conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved
in civility."	35.65650177001953
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	49.21149444580078
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	38.85788345336914
what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	46.68082046508789
the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine.	65.52752685546875
"i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister philips.	26.873586654663086
lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."	40.774600982666016
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton, these visitors came.	41.947227478027344
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly
calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	41.99118423461914
i do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
     be deceived again.	61.04873275756836
"did you go by the village of kympton?"	68.54618072509766
this is the estimation in which you hold me!	49.89674377441406
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	34.595821380615234
and rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr collins thus
addressed her,

"when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."	47.692626953125
our poor mother
     is sadly grieved.	39.8838996887207
"oh, lizzy!	35.90829849243164
her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	58.23875045776367
with many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for mrs bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"good lord!	52.115360260009766
but at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.	37.08491134643555
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.	39.1016960144043
you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."	54.407806396484375
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	71.40819549560547
but the fact is, that
being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, who, however, may live many years longer, i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
for several years.	35.47297668457031
but in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.	49.70283126831055
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	30.590620040893555
"i do not pretend to
regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	45.9548225402832
information about the mission of project gutenberg-tm

project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.	38.24631881713867
while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	22.572458267211914
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.	42.25925827026367
a
most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house!	90.79264068603516
my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
as i might have done!	42.089237213134766
"from the former.	33.444210052490234
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!	57.62324142456055
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	42.15909957885742
my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	46.06245422363281
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	40.473350524902344
"my dear, you flatter me.	73.99217987060547
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	114.85137939453125
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	39.17934799194336
but, alas!	4.873040676116943
mr darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr bingley
never stirs without him."	34.751285552978516
[illustration: morning dress.	42.0262336730957
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	54.32425308227539
mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone mr collins began.	49.67741775512695
mr darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	58.29603576660156
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your
     attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
     demand it of your justice.	32.5263557434082
the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than mr bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.	47.32654571533203
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia.	43.586830139160156
she was
sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	25.387826919555664
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am
_not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things."	34.798095703125
they were ignorant, idle, and vain.	79.34610748291016
mr bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. mrs bennet was quite
disconcerted.	41.83319091796875
"do you really think so?"	43.15208435058594
"and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty.	31.59222984313965
but,
my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	65.50675201416016
for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	35.82222366333008
what a fine thing for our girls!"	28.06224822998047
she wrote even
to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	18.0621337890625
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"miss elizabeth bennet."	36.14698791503906
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the project gutenberg-tm
collection.	64.27481842041016
without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.	29.55841636657715
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	58.74151611328125
you tear them to pieces."	30.091901779174805
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	61.513309478759766
she comes to us to-day.	43.94007110595703
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	73.20951843261719
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs long," said miss lucas, "but i
wish he had danced with eliza."	31.47179412841797
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	47.409393310546875
i shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on.	35.3319091796875
to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	32.568729400634766
perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	42.707435607910156
i cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done."	39.62687301635742
the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
dovedale, or the peak.	77.55711364746094
as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	44.2532844543457
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	48.52793502807617
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.	62.53142166137695
in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	44.070743560791016
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."	22.504941940307617
"i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen.	49.72547149658203
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	53.834136962890625
the hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.	25.08477020263672
but do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	49.480499267578125
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	41.2275390625
she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.	35.06248474121094
i was very
uncomfortable, i may say unhappy.	24.044334411621094
four nieces
of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	36.70908737182617
so tall!--oh, my
dear lizzy!	45.2193603515625
yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
first, you may remember."	41.87795639038086
my father bears it better.	75.80816650390625
"upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	54.55805587768555
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion.	53.47834396362305
sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	80.53358459472656
not a syllable was uttered by either; and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	56.78275680541992
1.f.6.	37.04874801635742
the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh!	54.32483673095703
his marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy."	55.91330337524414
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth.	44.59857940673828
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	40.80928039550781
mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	33.984779357910156
i wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if i had not asked you!	22.687410354614258
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley.	48.61429214477539
"i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked.	51.72857666015625
the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings.	49.75574493408203
"the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."	42.901729583740234
if you'll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight.	51.0417594909668
till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	34.4304084777832
"why, my dear, you must know, mrs long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."	171.03033447265625
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	32.23252868652344
only think!	46.07655715942383
"your's sincerely, &c."

miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	36.19457244873047
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."	24.899169921875
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	37.308650970458984
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.	44.29436111450195
i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr
darcy."	59.44347381591797
"i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr collins was wishing to
marry you.	53.700191497802734
"but does lydia know nothing of this?	51.064727783203125
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	69.91695404052734
as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	66.31350708007812
my visit was
not long, as caroline and mrs hurst were going out.	45.940208435058594
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	45.059566497802734
such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.	42.572452545166016
but she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.	13.346013069152832
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.	58.2285270690918
no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	42.677490234375
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	38.02277374267578
'tis as good as a lord!	62.468692779541016
on
mr and mrs gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	43.31635665893555
the least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	28.19190788269043
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	61.035282135009766
this invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	24.3743896484375
we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun!	49.03235626220703
"yes, she did."	42.60764694213867
and turning round, he looked for a moment at
elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	45.30008316040039
mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	40.61051940917969
"no more have i," said mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."	92.26763916015625
a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but mr darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	2.7370657920837402
"the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	63.50785446166992
oh!	49.20392608642578
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	49.98634719848633
she says lizzy had better have taken mr
collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	82.51798248291016
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	42.55509567260742
the reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as i have given above.	69.67145538330078
mr darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.	72.06568145751953
his appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	57.88083267211914
but is it
certain, absolutely certain?"	36.60938262939453
she was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr darcy,
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.	38.482688903808594
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it."	51.195247650146484
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	38.18088150024414
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
from netherfield, and was opened immediately.	47.93975830078125
you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, i am sure you did.	38.463069915771484
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

"what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam?	43.300655364990234
said
jane.--"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her."	55.817989349365234
"it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	36.50446319580078
have you heard from my uncle?"	46.83673095703125
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."	41.662925720214844
her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,

"i can guess the subject of your reverie."	41.56703186035156
and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	33.50916290283203
it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	54.629737854003906
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs
bennet instantly answered,

"oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am
sure she can have no objection.--come, kitty, i want you up stairs."	38.28242492675781
what relates to yourself, is as follows.	73.4842758178711
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	46.10162353515625
"'tis an etiquette i despise," said he.	54.84752655029297
she was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.	35.749595642089844
"aye, there she comes," continued mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided
she can have her own way.--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_i_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i
told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	34.297279357910156
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look
on as a point of duty.	44.97943878173828
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
mrs bennet give up the point.	43.55217361450195
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	65.96765899658203
"thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you
all, and then wickham would be angry."	48.07926559448242
"if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it."	34.83831024169922
of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself.	43.372802734375
well, how pleased i am!	32.223201751708984
"i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.	82.11933898925781
every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.	32.08696365356445
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	105.30731201171875
their powers of conversation were considerable.	31.473430633544922
i know not what to think.	55.5472412109375
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	30.360523223876953
i have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older."	50.51808547973633
"removed!"	42.66802978515625
but there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	61.87441635131836
their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach.	30.684812545776367
mrs long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.	29.242294311523438
hear me in silence.	25.175378799438477

had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."	42.031700134277344
has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	43.137454986572266
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	47.600067138671875
i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."	38.46910858154297
"he is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	53.52345657348633
i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner.	24.179067611694336
"they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	56.39013671875
but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	77.30176544189453
"indeed i am.	45.29714584350586
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	33.0547981262207
he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	31.558549880981445
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."	29.59784507751465
mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	49.744476318359375
"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
all."	37.009708404541016
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	30.394939422607422
who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	31.350738525390625
"has your governess left you?"	28.6169490814209
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days.	38.84652328491211
i understand that mr collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	31.0537109375
i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	61.50172805786133
had it been your uncle's doing, i must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	55.861045837402344
the business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	48.403133392333984
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon.	58.49409484863281
i was ready to die of laughter.	42.279727935791016
a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	44.41093063354492
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	55.597347259521484
"perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	46.7808837890625
perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now.	147.883056640625
when
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	42.644100189208984
"and so was i."	75.07357025146484
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him
ever since he was four years old."	48.265995025634766
are
you going much farther?"	59.70598220825195
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma?	40.49767303466797
"oh, jane,
take care."	38.474430084228516
he was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	33.78578186035156
mrs bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by
the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
meryton.	46.22444152832031
i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	62.81098556518555
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	37.088680267333984
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished.	33.62255096435547
has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	96.35321807861328
people do not die of little
trifling colds.	96.33802032470703
"exceed their income!	38.414981842041016
i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	33.758487701416016
"what could become of mr bingley and jane!"	31.19256019592285
it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."	37.924739837646484
"then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."	26.794971466064453
"about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i
understand."	34.15509033203125
"i must not decide on my own performance."	52.058135986328125
i knew how it
would be.	37.99930191040039
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	206.80584716796875
"mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."	52.27705383300781
"la!	51.82090759277344
"you are too hasty, sir," she cried.	41.21967697143555
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of
superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas."	52.519798278808594
at our time of life, it is not so
pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	73.11724090576172
the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	26.49241065979004
"oh!	38.92287063598633
mrs
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party.	38.5176887512207
only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	42.71079635620117
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	32.13606643676758
they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration.	50.71807861328125
"yes, in conjunction with his friend."	27.640867233276367
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
her resigned.	48.06468963623047
dear lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	45.300106048583984
"la!"	35.332801818847656
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her."	37.73332595825195
can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	32.708396911621094
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them.	48.1602668762207
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"	31.059473037719727
they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	52.741172790527344
i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	56.42832946777344
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr
darcy and herself.	40.10016632080078
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	45.590328216552734
mrs gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	65.01113891601562
that such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."	46.312503814697266
when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	20.08257293701172
"i suspected as much," replied elizabeth.	37.31625747680664
cried he, turning towards her.	37.23029708862305
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	37.57209014892578
"it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."	55.93647384643555
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	63.49850082397461
though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.	89.79039764404297
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	43.50166320800781
at length, she spoke again.	38.8269157409668
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.	57.357032775878906
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr
collins too!--why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"	38.05173110961914
they could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	36.2647819519043
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?"	54.621376037597656
said she.	32.573429107666016
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "oh!	59.655357360839844
your
reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.'	7.2836151123046875
lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
good humoured as lydia.	73.07252502441406

pride and prejudice:

a novel.	38.55048751831055
but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	44.8685417175293
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	50.258602142333984
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	33.40109634399414
"and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	32.78724670410156
colonel forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon.	34.60701370239258
my father is going to
     london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her.	52.510658264160156
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	39.373756408691406
our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----you shall try it
some day.--do your sisters play and sing?"	64.4599609375
"yes, she called yesterday with her father.	59.10365676879883
he delighted in
going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	43.0695686340332
but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	27.615055084228516
miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	39.79133224487305
"indeed i do not dare."	48.90000915527344
so imprudent a
     match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood.	44.07073211669922
could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?	37.820343017578125
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg-tm
license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1.	48.67504119873047
her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	37.7078857421875
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."	50.12753677368164
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.	53.87220764160156
all that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum.	28.921897888183594
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	14.626687049865723
these recollections will not do at
all.	43.15754699707031
"let us sit down.	39.007225036621094
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on wednesday or thursday.	37.038551330566406
"it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."

"that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	59.623451232910156
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	88.59521484375
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	29.92902374267578
"she is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	40.27357864379883
i cannot quite agree with you _there_.	35.548580169677734
she was teazed by
mr collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.	42.880470275878906
"if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to
understand it.	48.913597106933594
more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	39.422142028808594
"but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
every thing will be well."	39.85597229003906
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	77.01937866210938
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	61.29195785522461
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!	111.90325164794922
miss bingley i am sure cannot.	53.504058837890625
"what is there of good to be expected?"	167.8615264892578
"i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	49.348548889160156
"and this is your real opinion!	37.24959182739258
believe her to be deceived by all means.	30.45404815673828
one day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	48.08086395263672
a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and mrs bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.	12.645797729492188
she received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.	13.41055965423584
"insolent girl!"	57.62923049926758
things are settled so
oddly."	50.84073257446289
"what did you say of me, that i did not deserve?	49.07378005981445
the officer was the very
mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	74.12022399902344
before any answer could arrive from mr collins, or any congratulations
to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.	45.358551025390625
it was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	73.11724090576172
on entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	31.153560638427734
"oh!	41.62998962402344
"while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mr
bingley."	27.322223663330078
"another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with _him_,
if i were you."	52.599159240722656
adieu.	57.38572692871094
"why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley.	38.654541015625
"wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as jane's."	46.12038803100586
wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.	19.770355224609375
"but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."	42.99479293823242
"i never saw any one so shocked.	42.18825149536133
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	28.93386459350586
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	41.059200286865234
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	20.955623626708984
he had never had the
slightest suspicion.	51.281288146972656
"my dear father, i congratulate you."	39.31431198120117
she was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself.	37.624942779541016
"i am going
to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows."	66.67375183105469
"it is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	45.55500793457031
one
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	35.1884880065918
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	49.34634780883789
but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from the want of money.	50.07597732543945
your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."	62.75261688232422
come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.	53.73246383666992
i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield.	16.266557693481445
this was
very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	49.53403091430664
i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."	50.30402374267578
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object.	39.731407165527344
now, lizzy, i think i _have_
surprised you.	40.4846076965332
but, however, he is very welcome to
come to netherfield, if he likes it.	37.91481399536133
"do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa, you will not mind my
waking mr hurst."	47.54349136352539
my father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	44.31887435913086
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.	28.585805892944336
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	18.9622859954834
mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	87.17448425292969
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said
elizabeth.	65.82199096679688
"from mr collins!	61.06180191040039
elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	56.835418701171875
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	45.914894104003906
another day i will do the same; i will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as i can,--or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away."	66.69967651367188
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	37.547821044921875
"i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"	58.85478591918945
here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	43.72712326049805
she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	56.678932189941406
let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr
darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has
treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner.	61.90676498413086
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	42.581382751464844
my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	57.90587615966797
he had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us.	137.2761688232422
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once.	86.32093811035156
what congratulations will
then flow in!	52.013275146484375
he has
children of his own, and may have more.	47.03213882446289
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	2.7370657920837402
she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	38.26463317871094
oh!	68.28551483154297
but you have chosen your fault well.--i
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	38.732627868652344
he has not an ill-natured
look.	68.62590789794922
"i honour your circumspection.	43.94440460205078
i owe all that i know
of it, to another, not to you."	41.26091384887695
and she rose as she spoke.	40.669677734375
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again.	45.63561248779297
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane, who were dancing together.	34.9712028503418
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	78.56493377685547
what does he say?	41.92314910888672
it needed all
jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.	39.750274658203125
elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	50.194915771484375
from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry mr collins, and i will never see you again
if you _do_."	129.58517456054688
i am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	61.897850036621094
"as often as i can.	31.543365478515625
but
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	23.464372634887695
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley.	52.53199768066406
mrs long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	21.28602409362793
lord, how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty!	43.02360153198242
mrs bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."	31.78815460205078
the
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	76.48628997802734
"you have insulted me, in every possible method.	14.517643928527832
"very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	36.37538528442383
it was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	44.17267990112305
you must not suspect me.	37.100643157958984
"it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	81.47988891601562
his character
     was to speak for itself.	46.94181823730469
indeed, mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	84.2595443725586
"no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."	36.903141021728516
i have written to colonel forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which i have pledged myself.	80.88008880615234
but you do not know _all_.	48.071441650390625
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	62.02415466308594
"yes, sir, i know i am.	35.83620071411133
she related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	39.53912353515625
on both sides it was only assertion.	32.11692810058594
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.	51.52595901489258
how he must have felt it!"	56.43710708618164
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant.	37.20281219482422
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear
     wickham, you must be very happy.	24.48744773864746
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	42.88591384887695
"his misfortunes!"	37.5781364440918
well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	30.24043083190918
cried mrs bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	41.69414520263672
the note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	37.877342224121094
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	27.852354049682617

when she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.	68.77040100097656
at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	37.835357666015625
what am i to do?"	63.38136291503906
"he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."	56.89670181274414
"your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."	60.57191467285156
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	69.02313995361328
she was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr
darcy, she was directly retreating.	55.40761947631836
her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	39.20659637451172
my temper i dare not vouch
for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	31.959613800048828
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	45.935760498046875
"may i ask to what these questions tend?"	99.64875793457031
my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	22.421518325805664
"this is a wretched beginning indeed!	63.981170654296875
excuse me--for i must speak plainly.	68.64237213134766
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	43.29984664916992
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	38.458343505859375
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	52.91343307495117
there was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	73.11724090576172
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added kitty.	54.13875198364258
"oh!	50.8465576171875
in short, my dear aunt, i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	80.53358459472656
you are not going to be _missish_, i
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	32.375762939453125
1.e.6.	134.7589569091797
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!	61.35433578491211
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	45.23894500732422
elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	44.92087173461914
her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity.	206.7320098876953
"so, lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love i find.	103.04843139648438
"you did!	32.16545104980469
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.	30.363475799560547
i must speak to hill, this moment."	46.872520446777344
does she live near you, sir?"	200.6896514892578
"my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women's do.	42.1611328125
"money!	58.5020751953125
day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	102.75112915039062
"oh, no!"	43.558189392089844
"not at all.	33.07292175292969
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr bingley.	61.183013916015625
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	42.68479919433594
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long.	58.981380462646484
the feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	57.782108306884766
those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	54.52586364746094
then, the two third he danced with miss
king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----"

"if he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much!	27.015256881713867
he owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	32.84303665161133
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	30.283037185668945
"you have said quite enough, madam.	47.286685943603516
i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	40.997352600097656
we are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	37.095401763916016
the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.	57.62233352661133
i really do not think georgiana
darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	57.43891906738281
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i
hope, though you have but a short lease."	73.11724090576172
she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter.	44.5001335144043
"oh!	76.18925476074219
she has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."	156.57945251464844
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.	73.11724090576172
what is to become of us!	32.69383239746094
"oh!	52.246524810791016
i told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	55.652679443359375
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	46.422698974609375
she had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.	34.57029342651367
mr darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."	34.30887222290039
but it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham.	27.79730987548828
"my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.	51.76663589477539
"how should you have liked making sermons?"	40.10508346557617
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds
was of no trifling nature.	47.98563766479492
i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name.	34.829830169677734
"only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."	27.163408279418945
when tea was over, mr hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	57.104736328125
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly."	35.00959396362305
here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	42.757625579833984
"my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street."	37.77226257324219
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs bennet.--they had several children.	52.18699645996094
such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	28.8770694732666
"well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	52.82447052001953
"in the first place," replied mr gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland."	36.84486389160156
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another mr collins in time."	33.87281799316406
there
is nothing he would not do for her."	33.74334716796875
as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs bennet followed her,
saying,

"i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	31.22296714782715
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"oh!	54.387977600097656
my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.	60.38627624511719
miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.	45.98994064331055
she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.	49.86989974975586
had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	63.237579345703125
they are gone down to
newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, i do not know how long.	23.68105697631836
she saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	41.24174118041992
miss darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	15.830719947814941
"and may i ask?"	70.67591094970703
cried elizabeth.	51.7238883972168
the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	72.41178894042969
and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and mrs bennet, i am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.	2.7370657920837402
nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	65.05511474609375
oh!	55.36528396606445
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's
looks and behaviour.	86.5020751953125
but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	42.19629669189453
so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.	44.52812194824219
the whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	52.12980270385742
he now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
well as of mr darcy.	69.39635467529297
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	45.176246643066406
but mr bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	35.16819381713867
that _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	37.21684646606445
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	21.532272338867188
if she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.	31.953662872314453
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.
unless a copyright notice is included.	28.313966751098633
cried he.	44.13471984863281
"yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	135.92758178710938
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"i am not."	64.52432250976562
"i hope not so.	59.640506744384766
but it must not, shall not be.	57.06572723388672
they insist also on
     my seeing mr jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.	268.7760925292969
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.	104.19534301757812
what felicity!	45.92877960205078
she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	46.97544860839844
i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had."	22.39059829711914
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr darcy by
character perfectly well.	46.834407806396484
though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	63.979278564453125
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	49.51243209838867
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	32.35512924194336
elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.	29.62833023071289
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	60.47260665893555
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	33.69370651245117
she enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	48.6324462890625
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	36.143375396728516
*       *       *       *       *

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	47.45613479614258
our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."	48.602874755859375
the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	36.50455093383789
by supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.	33.164329528808594
"have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"	57.97245788574219
"but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that mrs long has promised to introduce him."	34.81264114379883
his pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by.	24.270910263061523
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	28.735885620117188
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.	27.90377426147461
who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after
your arrival!"	39.432071685791016
their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
at pemberley, before they left the country.	54.22209167480469
it was only said, 'lately,
george wickham, esq.	36.63496017456055
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	54.75320053100586
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.	27.89827537536621
well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next?	29.957767486572266
repeated miss bingley.	26.1990909576416
generous, good man, i am afraid he has
distressed himself.	50.883113861083984
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.	53.97882843017578
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	44.10810089111328
you have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.	45.92392349243164
who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	28.326801300048828
mr collins made his
declaration in form.	51.970970153808594
i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?"	42.799808502197266
and there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	118.35440063476562
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated.	44.59904861450195
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	44.189361572265625
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"	57.6292839050293
any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far."	11.098733901977539
she is quite a little
creature.	47.893184661865234
wretched, wretched, mistake!"	16.802892684936523
"she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."	63.58451461791992
mr bennet made no answer.	57.26378631591797
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	34.56842041015625
"and they _must_ marry!	53.59980773925781
"you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	64.52352142333984
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	45.036109924316406
her many attractions were again dwelt on, and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.	47.584930419921875
she had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	64.55789947509766
on the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me?	50.59474563598633
"mrs collins, you must send a servant with them.	52.83034896850586
"but,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	36.71158218383789
she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs hurst and
miss bingley.	50.29788589477539
we were
married, you know, at st. clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	46.142024993896484
"and then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	21.125051498413086
the first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached
     mr bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr
     wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--but
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--if, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry.--the
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i
     had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with
     others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the
     dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that
     ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made
     acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that
     bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage.	36.3426628112793
they
followed her into the dining-parlour.	67.32086181640625
but mrs
bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	76.23482513427734
the girls stared at their father.	9.753663063049316
"gracechurch-street, sept. 6.	43.24269104003906
the tête-à-tête surprised
them.	60.75553894042969
she really
looked almost wild."	36.496192932128906
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	74.93669891357422
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly."	39.96632385253906
_we_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."	52.76787567138672
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	50.103214263916016
you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."	44.32239532470703
but he is an ugly fellow!	41.07301330566406
it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	28.885683059692383
mrs bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth,

"miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	26.192602157592773
by you, i was properly humbled.	51.431880950927734
we passed each other
several times.	54.976768493652344
it would be dreadful!	31.17611312866211
it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	17.08329200744629
anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	43.50421905517578
"but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
next day."	12.296899795532227
[illustration: a vicarage house.]	34.73480224609375
a clergyman like you must marry.--chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.	46.15690231323242
"you write uncommonly fast."	42.964454650878906
lady
catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.	36.75450134277344
if you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.	45.585975646972656
"_you_ began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs bennet with civil
self-command to miss lucas.	46.97158432006836
"he is certainly a good brother," said elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	61.80173873901367
you must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."	24.07008171081543
the housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	49.8061408996582
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection."	48.440940856933594
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	57.37010192871094
mrs
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	47.76707077026367
but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	39.889198303222656
but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."	49.53007125854492
"and you saw him frequently?"	42.581153869628906
"by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; i wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer
     for being coherent.	30.73512077331543
i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	45.69431686401367
i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	92.10894775390625
but we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."	43.88650894165039
what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.	48.54837417602539
your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	57.49158477783203
at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."	45.41870880126953
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	42.03395462036133
"i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper i ever met with.	43.10186767578125
in her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	46.86253356933594
as for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin elizabeth."	40.7405891418457
miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present.	24.91781234741211
how does georgiana get on, darcy?"	47.380462646484375
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	72.6899642944336
"is that his design in settling here?"	38.58144760131836
the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"are you pleased with kent?"	73.11724090576172
by mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	45.7861442565918
"the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.	42.63900375366211
"oh!	43.04684829711914
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	30.943361282348633
kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton.	47.662864685058594
"we have heard only once.	28.61810874938965
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	40.85896301269531
"but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
opportunity."	64.07890319824219
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."	44.7441520690918
you have widely mistaken my
character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	49.108646392822266
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world i love, and he is an angel.	8.161383628845215
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	44.274559020996094
this mrs
     younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	37.945770263671875
heaven forbid!	25.87712287902832
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.	56.39702224731445
"laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	62.88900375366211
did he know of
their intending to go off?	80.85819244384766
her answer was warmly in his favour.	50.75275802612305
in this danger kitty
is also comprehended.	40.13051223754883
"but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	16.879985809326172
and one of my
own daughters.	65.97967529296875
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	36.86614227294922
three daughters married!	30.765832901000977
he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in derbyshire.	36.74905014038086

she now lost every expectation of pleasure.	34.095802307128906
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.	48.19888687133789
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	47.032310485839844
you have a sweet room here, mr bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	32.474361419677734
"you are severe on us."	42.64497375488281
"there can be no doubt of that.	50.41621780395508
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	39.49913787841797
"she is so fond of mrs forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!	50.3810920715332
"she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.	43.014705657958984
after a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	70.0290298461914
when she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	36.91713333129883
"i do not believe a word of it, my dear.	31.99022674560547
"so much the better.	50.7931022644043
i _must_ have employment and society.	49.30496597290039
you
may have drawn him in."	261.43157958984375
to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	45.76820373535156
but jane was to go home with her, and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	33.47655487060547
and his
answering immediately to the last question--oh!	76.27432250976562
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	48.675933837890625

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	47.69356918334961
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	44.926761627197266
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."	43.871002197265625
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	179.5362548828125
had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	85.66388702392578
lady
catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	22.47369956970215
i was never more annoyed!	72.51348114013672
"does that young lady know mr darcy?"	33.53266525268555
his sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.	60.698753356933594
to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	44.47172164916992
her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	37.67817306518555
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of mr darcy, she could not
but allow that mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	50.31753158569336
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to mr bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	67.32433319091797
and who knows what _may_ happen?	70.46603393554688
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	48.493621826171875
"certainly not; at first.	42.36066818237305
your's, very
     sincerely,

     "m.	68.36833953857422
he has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	60.745113372802734
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	44.39424514770508
"_you_ observed it, mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."	49.44657897949219
cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	37.30600357055664
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	48.32399368286133
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library."	25.350303649902344
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."	89.64348602294922
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	206.80584716796875
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	23.353397369384766
forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."	45.19939041137695
darcy mentioned his letter.	49.14007568359375
"la!	43.2563362121582
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	60.65532684326172
"good gracious!	49.015193939208984
the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year.	44.16632843017578
he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire.	22.776853561401367
she could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	37.901580810546875
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	69.07218933105469
she will follow wherever lydia leads.	38.07112503051758
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	50.1427001953125
"no--why should he?	63.2837028503418
they were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	73.3275375366211
no.--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."	51.400978088378906
"indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	26.45596694946289
"i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	42.869991302490234
but slyness seems the fashion.	73.11724090576172
"i advise mr darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs bennet, "to walk
to oakham mount this morning.	45.573204040527344
"excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant."	33.89476776123047
but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."	34.75691223144531
"oh!	71.63607788085938
you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	51.120059967041016
towards _him_ i have been
kinder than towards myself."	49.959129333496094
"that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."	39.61919403076172
"and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently.	59.86208724975586
and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,

"indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	52.8270149230957
he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	48.738399505615234
*       *       *       *       *

"good gracious!"	48.213069915771484
she was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	46.5244140625
amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	40.69350814819336
"my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.	42.814659118652344
their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially,
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	29.64597511291504
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.	48.904232025146484
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist
mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.	46.815643310546875
two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, mrs bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	52.16300582885742
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."	43.42742156982422
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	32.65561294555664
"i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	56.872718811035156
but we are all liable to
error.	20.335779190063477
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	37.79056167602539
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	36.794273376464844
no one but mrs bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.	54.10772705078125
other schemes too came into her head.	66.15274810791016
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	36.67664337158203
"we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine and
lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.	59.16585922241211
"a gamester!"	41.73294448852539
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which
i have not already heard.	37.763450622558594
you must not disappoint your father."	64.72425079345703
were questions with which she amused herself.	38.36349868774414
your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	35.46448516845703
i cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family."	46.9172477722168
wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."	42.01513671875
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	56.19742965698242
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."	33.83405685424805
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time.	12.88180923461914
it is really too distressing.	36.56699752807617
but tell me, what did you come down to
netherfield for?	35.70175552368164
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	14.867005348205566
sir william had been
delighted with him.	31.52602195739746
"i have just had a letter from
jane, with such dreadful news.	23.106334686279297
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm
license terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	49.83293533325195
see paragraph 1.e below.	73.42879486083984
_i_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	33.57286834716797
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring?"	34.9415283203125
he
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	55.030330657958984
how i long to see her!	42.47482681274414
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time.	36.862091064453125
"i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."	52.150856018066406
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.	28.047868728637695
a young man, such
as you describe mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	57.618656158447266
but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	36.070106506347656
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	29.112327575683594
my poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room.	42.3129768371582
_my_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property.	25.335071563720703
i am sure you must feel it
so."	40.78010177612305
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."	57.72138595581055
what a good joke it will be!	28.642122268676758
"mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself?"	39.96973419189453
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	41.66609573364258
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	49.100650787353516
stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."	54.3536491394043
allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	53.4928092956543
having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	58.45785140991211
you dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."	52.313385009765625
"nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	45.37610626220703
have you seen any pleasant men?	55.15495300292969
it was an
encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
very strenuously have opposed it.	64.16990661621094
"do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	102.9350357055664
"if i," said mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	44.144020080566406
that his two sisters and mr darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	48.99526596069336
but, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."	49.83189392089844
"not the slightest.	36.34422302246094
and you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."	46.351959228515625
they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically anything with public domain ebooks.	32.67355728149414
i know your
disposition, lizzy.	60.342525482177734
"if he wants our society, let
him seek it.	35.72561264038086
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr bennet
came from it.	54.13496780395508
during their walk, it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	53.673709869384766
she did indeed.	44.843997955322266
no principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy.	78.74713897705078
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.	16.19130516052246
"i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	66.06735229492188
but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."	57.222049713134766
i was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	116.93526458740234
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor."	55.56862258911133
"a man who had felt less, might."	52.76194763183594
the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you.	28.272829055786133
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	24.191774368286133
my sisters may write to _me_.	48.935794830322266
mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	47.24883270263672
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	44.61869430541992
said jane.	43.52312088012695
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	51.17125701904297
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.	36.662750244140625
i knew it myself, as
     it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--it is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer.	47.12334060668945
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	34.95829772949219
"yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."	64.56233215332031
their table was superlatively stupid.	36.331504821777344
happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!"	49.44615936279297
you know pretty well, i suppose,
     what has been done for the young people.	51.03436279296875
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	54.00511169433594
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	40.80436706542969
"yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."	53.17413330078125
as yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.	24.12917137145996
"i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said darcy.	56.09000015258789
she had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	50.25400924682617
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	43.856204986572266
poor
jane!	46.948516845703125
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	34.268592834472656
when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	41.42658233642578
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	43.9744873046875
the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country.	48.00900650024414
the strangeness of mr collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	54.27296447753906
"mr darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	78.869384765625
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs
hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	44.074581146240234
i am not equal to it.	46.53465270996094
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	17.6594295501709
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	51.93034744262695
the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.	61.75954818725586
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage.	80.68988037109375
did she call to refuse her consent?"	38.74782180786133
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give.	124.57901763916016
i shall see her in january.	60.80332565307617
"you never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	72.723388671875
you have employed your
time much better.	107.40093994140625
no, never.	43.30476379394531
i hope you have destroyed the letter.	39.415374755859375
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	40.9854850769043
"my uncle is to send a servant for us."	46.31684494018555
"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	51.20612716674805
"she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	43.277503967285156
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."	30.97317886352539
it was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	54.512176513671875
the promised
letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	38.0328254699707
"as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	40.6617317199707
you take
delight in vexing me.	85.6611099243164
society, i own, is necessary to me.	111.52317810058594
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"	76.88988494873047
"oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice.	38.262386322021484
put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	45.94466781616211
"i think you said she was a widow, sir?	36.00045394897461
the
rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	33.35353469848633
when i went away, i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again!	51.14716720581055
they soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	70.17491149902344
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's
way."	31.504653930664062
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."	41.663692474365234
they had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	41.76873016357422
i do not know who is
good enough for him."	41.20046615600586
his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	54.55736541748047
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham."	44.93362045288086
having said thus much, i feel no
     doubt of your secrecy.	52.800994873046875
but if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	37.210418701171875
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
by herself.	51.7600212097168
jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	57.03436279296875
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which mr darcy afterwards discharged.	45.88597106933594
"you have a house in town, i conclude?"	23.46195411682129
they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	73.11724090576172
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.	47.73188400268555
"no, indeed, i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's
connections.	59.15155792236328
she had obtained private intelligence that mr
darcy did not wish for cards; and mr hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	44.992698669433594
"oh!	40.6778678894043
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	61.138282775878906
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	43.81597137451172
her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	45.47271728515625
"yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	71.98442077636719
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
with mrs hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
london.	36.730979919433594
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	37.567169189453125
on this subject, what can you have to
say?	45.388492584228516
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"in vain have i struggled.	38.736846923828125
he
is so excessively handsome!	68.03726196289062
all
elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	32.94966125488281
dear me!	27.75811767578125
i cannot
     understand it.	32.62480545043945
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it."	55.45210266113281
i am going to-morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	33.679988861083984
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	32.32015609741211
"she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley.	48.71923065185547
it cannot last long.	56.5423469543457
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."	40.374267578125
risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."	48.449058532714844
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr bennet, "and
nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.	63.758056640625
you refuse, then, to oblige me.	51.8917121887207
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	30.86548614501953
mr darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	49.835147857666016
but it was not to be.	45.446739196777344
"for the liveliness of your mind, i did."	56.45513916015625
but these things happen so often!	47.05620193481445
my dear, dear jane, i am so
happy!	21.309480667114258
when mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	28.917890548706055
his affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.	35.25419998168945
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	47.0650749206543
i know no harm of her."	33.100563049316406
"this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	77.72007751464844
i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together."	24.607324600219727
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be
placed in the gallery at pemberley.	38.180419921875
let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay.	80.16382598876953
of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	44.830440521240234
mr bingley arrived.	54.54616928100586
my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	70.36993408203125
as a
child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
temper.	48.41288375854492
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	48.24314880371094
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	35.37040710449219
i have
not the smallest hope.	51.364524841308594
"to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."	41.309627532958984
but
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy mr collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's
praise into his own hands.	26.524953842163086
"if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."	42.810401916503906
this preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	48.346195220947266
a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern.	46.06288528442383
i am
afraid you will be angry."	53.420684814453125
"i am glad i bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	28.84307098388672
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	44.2915153503418
she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	30.22616195678711
"there
is nothing the matter with me.	16.28307342529297
his character is thereby complete."	27.049209594726562
"i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."	29.392314910888672
"that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever
heard you utter.	18.681076049804688
you know my sentiments."	51.815914154052734
it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	51.39027786254883
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	41.93102264404297
mary and kitty, thank
heaven!	43.911529541015625
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.	39.939640045166016
but now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	50.94822692871094
my uncle!"	37.917354583740234
you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	58.527854919433594
while
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	47.81358337402344
they went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	20.48162078857422
"it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	40.38978576660156
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr
wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	39.968780517578125
about a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate;
     and thither also went mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs
     younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	364.9618225097656
they are gone off together
from brighton.	45.6111946105957
"what is his name?"	44.615234375
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	45.12792205810547
he had to be sure done much.	19.725927352905273
but, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane.	50.30840301513672
mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	25.368303298950195
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	39.10558319091797
"what do you mean?"	72.71232604980469
"i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."	44.36607360839844
ten thousand a year!	48.71916961669922
mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	39.426307678222656
wherever you and jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly
sisters.	26.557960510253906
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."	47.06110382080078
a report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	46.775753021240234
they are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	37.87617874145508
i hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point."	26.462379455566406
neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach."	26.573387145996094
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
mr collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure."	19.526498794555664
eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	48.635704040527344
let her go then.	42.233367919921875
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!	34.66134262084961
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!	21.638519287109375
you deserve no such attention.	41.723426818847656
"it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began.	27.69363784790039
have a little
compassion on my nerves.	46.57280349731445
bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence.	115.8858871459961
"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said elizabeth.	49.29001235961914
i know it to be impossible."	33.26210021972656
after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	42.93669128417969
she finds miss pope a treasure.	40.947166442871094
his doing so
drew her notice.	55.065399169921875
"i confess," said he, "that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings.	12.822653770446777
this information, however, startled mrs bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.	65.8385009765625
they gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	49.26072692871094
"but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return."	45.524593353271484
there is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, i dare say."	46.199562072753906
"no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton."	50.916534423828125
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	70.74152374267578
jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	14.416540145874023
"you are quite a visit in my debt, mr bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	50.334739685058594
her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr darcy then
was.	57.51780319213867
she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	25.628408432006836
_her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	35.30551528930664
cried mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley!	50.785972595214844
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	34.5837287902832
do not let us
quarrel about the past.	35.364261627197266
people _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
it is not true.	46.41505432128906
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and
lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	38.654422760009766
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	39.03800964355469
"there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?"	27.714326858520508
they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs
bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	50.192134857177734
if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better.	8.183866500854492
both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	80.53358459472656
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr
darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	31.62571144104004
the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.	34.15326690673828
jane shook her head.	36.266448974609375
1.f.1.	31.487638473510742
can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"	59.12972640991211
if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy!	45.332855224609375
but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	53.205284118652344
cried elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.	33.21064758300781
mr collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	104.08807373046875
in every view it
is unaccountable!"	45.459129333496094
mr
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	34.658531188964844
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_."	49.72307586669922
i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	44.08805465698242
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george
wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the
late mr darcy's steward.	24.39863395690918
she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	41.40088653564453
he was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	64.66014862060547
"i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	9.88215446472168
said elizabeth.	84.13479614257812
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	51.050537109375
they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	46.429420471191406
1.e.8.	35.13254165649414
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy.	215.11114501953125
with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	22.266193389892578
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.	26.38667869567871
elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	35.972503662109375
"no.	14.79710578918457
i do not believe she often sees such at home."	40.008583068847656
her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	9.918041229248047
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	70.97158813476562
"to-morrow fortnight."	52.846195220947266
"yes, very different.	52.89130783081055
my fingers wait your orders."	47.2874641418457
"she is a very fine-looking woman!	39.83757781982422
they saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	56.713623046875
despite these efforts, project gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.	53.229244232177734
but i
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london.	63.27280807495117
i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, i should not pay him half so much deference.	47.248260498046875
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	58.020328521728516
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	69.52589416503906
"i will not be interrupted.	45.47547149658203
to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	51.7884521484375
"i am," said he, with a firm voice.	47.26351547241211
now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?	41.92932891845703
i should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	48.71247100830078
said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	36.546043395996094
mr darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	33.73374557495117
she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	48.00170135498047
"no, nothing at all."	47.06539535522461
he is gone to my father already.	39.438995361328125
"of music!	39.036827087402344
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!	41.23806381225586
mrs bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	67.93537139892578
you may imagine what i felt
     and how i acted.	32.59286880493164
but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	38.96267318725586
"lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room."	33.54411697387695
"you are over scrupulous surely.	41.49618911743164
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	58.83747482299805
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you
joy?"	53.90705108642578
if you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday
     se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as
     lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day.	45.70248031616211
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr wickham.	52.365074157714844
but
nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done.	69.45402526855469
redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.	35.701637268066406
i need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	24.39923095703125
he will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."	102.73379516601562
how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?	45.910186767578125
"what could he mean?	51.66605758666992
in three volumes.	46.640472412109375
"well, so much the better.	24.39863395690918
if i
had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
him.	69.80523681640625
but the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."	47.667755126953125
he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	43.611576080322266
said elizabeth.	33.16460418701172
and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is
the usual price of an earl's younger son?	33.508331298828125
"well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	67.36393737792969
"i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring.	81.34235382080078
"what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	31.53302001953125
for god's sake, say no more of
his partners.	58.77931594848633
i must conclude, for i cannot be
     long from my poor mother.	101.64352416992188
mamma, do the
people here abouts know i am married to-day?	39.44601058959961
"upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	41.59231948852539
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	46.00383758544922
"complied with!	121.9421615600586
this was agreed to, and mrs philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	90.25618743896484
you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	54.30467224121094
and, above all things, keep mr bennet from
fighting.	151.29891967773438
how are they even to be discovered?	33.383888244628906
it distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
parsonage.	46.357643127441406
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	53.91248321533203
all loveliness and goodness as she is!	40.21190643310547
i had not an idea of it."	75.8738021850586
in that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	27.171207427978516
_i_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	42.131614685058594
mrs bennet, we shall have her
at netherfield at last.'	45.43173599243164
how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!	42.39760971069336
and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	43.53553009033203
"mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	101.51124572753906
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"	37.230735778808594
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.	34.12217712402344
from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr
collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed.	52.35316467285156
i
am sure my sisters must all envy me.	78.92780303955078
"in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	73.11724090576172
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	33.698341369628906
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.	39.839298248291016
but she is nothing to me now.	40.97333908081055
"oh!	67.83871459960938
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	51.4719123840332
but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"	82.7032470703125
he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	40.26222229003906
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	40.739898681640625
a few days after this visit, mr bingley called again, and alone.	115.40888214111328
do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.	46.30161666870117
the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.	46.65648651123047
it was dated
from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.	39.79560089111328
perhaps he thought her too young.	43.542999267578125
mr darcy danced
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	56.79789352416992
"he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"	37.134361267089844
there is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town.	39.21003723144531
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness.	63.559688568115234
you and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, mr bingley might like you the best of the
party."	32.454341888427734
in the former were many good paintings;
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	26.488374710083008
a great deal more passed at the
other table.	86.37508392333984
after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.	52.01288986206055
she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	53.96430206298828
he now wished it more than ever.	58.91850662231445
elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	46.1573486328125
but
these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	46.80821990966797
now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	40.551361083984375
she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	55.61017990112305
i will speak to her about it myself directly.	36.24285125732422
"i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.	48.53109359741211
elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.	45.24917221069336
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	62.50926971435547
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.	45.58884048461914
as a clergyman, moreover, i
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	42.37928009033203
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	27.143476486206055
the compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	63.873870849609375
"the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting.	44.921485900878906
"now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy.	73.11724090576172
your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	56.78687286376953
your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	49.78554153442383
a flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	36.15926742553711
"oh!	36.46681594848633
mrs collins knew not what to make of him.	50.345584869384766
"what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!"	43.60832214355469
"yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	52.21446990966797
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	43.399253845214844
it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham.	59.377464294433594
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
at all."	35.77191925048828
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"	14.301716804504395
but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will
take it on myself."	55.097415924072266
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy,
"of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.	34.50163650512695
"go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	73.40215301513672
but that is one great difference between
us.	87.93079376220703
elizabeth was delighted.	165.47315979003906
he merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."	30.979753494262695
"if one could but go to brighton!"	55.019840240478516
but are you pleased,
jane?	33.405311584472656
it was really a very
handsome thought.	52.2451171875
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	48.90388107299805
pray forgive
     me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
     have been all round the park.	79.50001525878906
my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."	45.527896881103516
it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	38.78352355957031
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three
weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	42.507022857666016
it was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	59.09722900390625
elizabeth
was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	60.28828430175781
"well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	66.21205139160156
"heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me
such an evil."	38.01613998413086
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	57.50438690185547
i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say.	45.92915725708008
the sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	58.67727279663086
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	40.57093811035156
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed.	36.17692184448242
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her.	88.44925689697266
"this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune!	33.5284309387207
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not
return it.	71.94474792480469
she longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to
jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.	47.83734893798828
"no, indeed.	50.64649200439453
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful."	46.810569763183594
"indeed, mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	61.66856002807617
his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
mr darcy with a very expressive smile.	61.38283157348633
"are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"	40.79004669189453
"you are then resolved to have him?"	35.40727615356445
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	64.99781036376953
she felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.	53.214698791503906
they look upon it
quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens."	48.02771759033203
"can i have the carriage?"	80.53358459472656
he promises fairly, and i hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent.	56.45481872558594
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	37.43431091308594
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	47.09165573120117
1.b.	35.56747817993164
she could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	38.401145935058594
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c. are
sufficiently known.	38.45444107055664
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	26.78028678894043
he shall not be in love with me, if i
can prevent it."	38.44477844238281
elizabeth replied that it was.	43.9915771484375
"not that i _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."	50.1033821105957
"what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr
darcy had much better finish his letter."	60.55155563354492
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	67.52975463867188
she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	43.51688766479492
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
not rest till i knew the particulars.	34.263275146484375
"believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	53.454715728759766
it was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	73.11724090576172
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states.	46.646854400634766
"all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."	55.50910949707031
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	60.97407913208008
"oh!	48.06638717651367
she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."	93.75250244140625
this son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	64.31930541992188
it exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.	45.890316009521484
"is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare
that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means most kindly!	38.66850662231445
"can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	46.5721321105957
sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	58.85728454589844
but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton;
and the hursts have no horses to theirs."	41.09729766845703
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet, and
mrs hurst was observing their game.	40.706451416015625
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	45.12373733520508
"and that," said mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.	43.08119201660156
not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.	25.959274291992188
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure
you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do.	33.775875091552734
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	39.303279876708984
brother-in-law of wickham!	24.344507217407227
he took the hint,
and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"that will do extremely well, child.	42.57007598876953
she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	55.7492561340332
mrs bennet was not in the
habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	51.23836898803711
i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly.	43.98231887817383
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
think it is well expressed."	59.80117416381836
"and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?"	29.440706253051758
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.	66.11538696289062
this was one point, with
regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	45.870323181152344
he was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_
a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.'	26.451784133911133
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too!	43.72031784057617
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	37.88697052001953
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson; did not
i mention it to you?	45.051475524902344
he could even
listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st. james's, with very decent composure.	26.30070686340332
how i laughed!	48.1400032043457
thought she.	62.85116195678711
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr darcy.	43.3511962890625
"how strange!"	53.453006744384766
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a
lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr darcy, drawing near
elizabeth, said to her--

"do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"	44.87564468383789
his consenting to marry
her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	68.18787384033203
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	41.16120147705078
she seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.	40.50168228149414
his temptation is
not adequate to the risk."	83.64198303222656
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	35.84404373168945
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.	50.5937614440918
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	38.15225601196289
but vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	20.881614685058594
i shall go distracted."	47.25588607788086
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	45.44455337524414
give my love to colonel forster, i hope you
     will drink to our good journey.	15.830719947814941
he was very fond of them."	53.95064926147461
he
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	31.911230087280273
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.	43.697479248046875
cried elizabeth.	29.34821891784668
if i have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured mr wickham, i can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family.	33.375301361083984
when a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."	40.76628112792969
no look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	42.30768966674805
"yes, indeed," cried mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	45.584449768066406
mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs bennet.	36.46441650390625
elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	55.45077896118164
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr
hurst had a house.	55.84439468383789
but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem.	42.84017562866211
at night she opened her heart to jane.	42.61092758178711
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	35.4820442199707
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"jane, i congratulate you.	38.85710144042969
but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	40.04841995239258
contact the
foundation as set forth in section 3 below.	53.35023498535156
"nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	32.00993347167969
"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."	41.1765251159668
he
then said,

"i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.	35.896263122558594
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	56.07416915893555

"why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."	42.32355880737305
mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	52.508628845214844
"i see no occasion for that.	54.39534378051758
this letter is from mr collins."	63.03391647338867
"i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	48.841007232666016
"my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?"	28.812713623046875
"it must have been his sister's doing.	38.479881286621094
with a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	79.10956573486328
it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	48.05231475830078
she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	70.38372802734375
her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	44.721923828125
"well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?	92.5738296508789
her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.	46.543907165527344
"you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	23.428508758544922
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"let me call your maid.	42.354026794433594
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	64.34716033935547
"i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	566.7015380859375

the letter was to this
effect:

     "my dear lizzy,

     "i wish you joy.	73.11724090576172
the lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	40.68526077270508
"if!	32.57538604736328
"miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	31.7247257232666
"oh!	59.585506439208984
however, i
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for mr darcy might have done as well."	38.228904724121094
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	19.685476303100586
from
what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	37.90853500366211
"what do you mean, hill?	42.14052963256836
mr darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life!	42.541954040527344
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
saw any thing of it.	37.72875213623047
he has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."	34.82278823852539
an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.	57.98851776123047
yet, indeed, i am
in earnest.	34.65510940551758
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.	43.17621612548828
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	45.58829879760742
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	53.02935791015625
but georgiana would not join
her.	71.6134262084961
his surprise was great.	30.667295455932617
"i have heard much of your master's fine person," said mrs gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	41.907493591308594
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"did not you think, mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?"	34.52822494506836
for the last week they had seen very little
of either lady catherine or her daughter.	83.2481918334961
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	56.72660446166992
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st. james's.	50.8471794128418
and it was not wholly without foundation.	50.20726013183594
the day passed much as the day before had done.	49.3488655090332
and so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	60.53010940551758
no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	11.08838939666748
at present i am not in love with
mr wickham; no, i certainly am not.	51.266483306884766
mr wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed.	42.93879318237305
i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	92.65653991699219
cried lydia.	50.33158874511719
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	50.87744903564453
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.	53.30161666870117
"oh, lord!	43.29047775268555
and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	26.750919342041016
thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."	63.42695999145508
the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	30.04107666015625
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.	19.363162994384766
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.	47.833003997802734
they were, therefore, to go.--elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	55.47698974609375
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	37.06849670410156
"books--oh!	71.68569946289062
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	68.17781829833984
"what will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are!	40.69890213012695
additional terms will be linked
to the project gutenberg-tm license for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.	131.26834106445312
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	15.081480979919434
there was no arguing upon such a project.	74.09972381591797
she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	42.7640266418457
and so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?	41.778446197509766
wickham only shook his head.	27.883121490478516
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	55.326332092285156
every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	30.53413963317871
we have not met since the 26th of november, when
we were all dancing together at netherfield."	52.40481185913086
i do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	33.43497848510742
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	66.5786361694336
the prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	46.129737854003906
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	61.61021423339844
i was uncomfortable enough.	27.53141212463379
i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	35.797916412353516
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself."	44.80459213256836
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.	55.04368591308594
every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.	33.635467529296875
"care of him!--yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care.	47.523616790771484
she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	58.450347900390625
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	52.09564208984375
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	84.48355102539062
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	38.71323776245117
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	49.51584243774414
and i think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.	45.002525329589844
i had not
believed it possible."	56.93597412109375
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland.	50.66133499145508
she had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	55.96211242675781
"a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	20.15245246887207
"have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?	81.7939224243164
"that is right.--you could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.	54.20394515991211
the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	44.70296096801758
with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted!	33.22158432006836
"blame you!	41.714324951171875
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	100.17611694335938
_i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	59.71107864379883
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at brighton.	35.393096923828125
"perfectly so--i thank you."	32.552852630615234
well!	21.643178939819336
this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	47.206687927246094
their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	29.188993453979492
till this moment, i never knew myself."	39.56398010253906

but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	61.26008987426758
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	65.87506103515625
the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	33.88231658935547
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir
william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.	41.73683166503906
far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	47.51911926269531
her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	24.36347198486328
younger sons cannot marry
where they like."	49.61522674560547
the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.	43.92054748535156
one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.	42.44322204589844
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	44.38310241699219
"oh, yes.	32.86565017700195
my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	38.03437042236328
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	36.57114791870117
lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention.	87.18746185302734
miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	47.178443908691406
she liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	50.07063674926758
miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	27.29638671875
my sweetest lizzy!	39.56120681762695
but, on second thoughts,
perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."	42.03608703613281
lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard,
and if he does, colonel forster will hire him.	48.00416946411133
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."	36.07284164428711
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr collins
very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	35.501468658447266
he is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.	75.94767761230469
but there
are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am
ever to pay him."	76.91020202636719
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	85.48405456542969
his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative.	45.74051284790039
it is every way horrible!"	63.182273864746094
"it is no such thing.	78.3104476928711
one came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	44.694854736328125
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	36.67978286743164
she had a sister married to a mr philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade.	30.970869064331055
but i have
other provocations.	118.7795181274414
he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you
cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	32.861454010009766
during dinner, mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	63.463722229003906
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	84.34468078613281
"why will you think so?	51.851505279541016
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	21.484783172607422

it was all
     over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been.	52.55564498901367
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	33.52366638183594
cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted.	29.467119216918945
there can be no love in all this.	33.14513397216797
had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	49.182464599609375
i am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	42.97831344604492
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	44.04269790649414
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	53.38517761230469
what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received!	55.75922393798828
sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine."	32.74541473388672
"you either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire."	26.484119415283203
"_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.	57.115684509277344
his regiment is there; for i suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	36.47146224975586
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	55.368263244628906
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	46.31705093383789
mr
     darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	43.563228607177734
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	41.38307571411133
i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	49.246089935302734
he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure
_i_ never want to see him again.	40.53303909301758
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."	60.33188247680664
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	57.98440170288086
"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	45.804508209228516
in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	50.20256423950195
with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"	55.18184280395508
his revenge would have been complete indeed.	27.848726272583008
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.	143.99183654785156
they battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved.	37.67681884765625
i was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr darcy.	55.61572265625
"yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	56.56880187988281
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking.	35.584312438964844
in the absence of jane,
he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	44.24503707885742
it is highly improper.	47.03529357910156
at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs hurst and
elizabeth herself.	57.4225959777832
vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	37.79734420776367
why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	76.24854278564453
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	33.27406692504883
i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention;
the other is charlotte's marriage.	40.129173278808594
mr collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	55.78624725341797
mr darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	32.796661376953125
after this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	37.94106674194336
mr collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	45.5518684387207
mr collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	45.407989501953125
my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	33.932395935058594
i know you will contrive it all."	31.40860939025879
never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her.	28.30252456665039
but before they heard again from mr gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from mr collins; which, as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	49.435325622558594
nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	31.36427116394043
a person may be
proud without being vain.	36.22077178955078
mr collins!"	36.16498565673828
"that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	33.6196403503418
i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	35.65461349487305
human nature is so prone to
fall into it!	39.766815185546875
"to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	90.5397720336914
he has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."	47.94850540161133
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."	27.524560928344727
presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	28.052656173706055
the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	42.03852081298828
much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going
to be married.	50.331748962402344
i _will_ leave him to himself."	34.94355773925781
that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.	30.757448196411133
you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."	64.29778289794922
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	55.96889114379883
"yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	23.98053741455078
_that_ abominable mr darcy!--my father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.	10.873523712158203
the whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	46.95922088623047
"no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	75.47467803955078
it will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."	83.54640197753906
how could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"	52.97024917602539
they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr
bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.	51.05887222290039
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is
impossible.	81.0324935913086
"did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	21.98031997680664
multiple
      superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets
      example: m^{rs}.	50.56008529663086
she enquired into charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	42.33295822143555
"good heaven!	43.25545120239258
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	32.53989791870117
mrs
bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger!	26.161605834960938
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	22.55666732788086
she is
not such a simpleton.	60.097103118896484
"and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters."	40.6281852722168
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	37.83933639526367
his air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	29.82075309753418
this cannot be!	92.83964538574219
pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.	55.909645080566406
in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to mr darcy were by no means over.	52.03412628173828
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	51.891056060791016
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	31.346885681152344
"i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have
not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	319.0938415527344
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"	53.40894317626953
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	43.52848434448242
lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr
collins first came to hunsford."	42.1779670715332
"how so?	55.516151428222656
i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	39.238651275634766
five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing.	42.61997604370117
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	27.59836769104004
they were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities.	23.496707916259766
if _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	17.497615814208984

you shall hear what she says."	49.08803176879883
your idea of the ponies is delightful.	53.21255874633789
there was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	35.06776809692383
i have faults enough,
but they are not, i hope, of understanding.	53.249664306640625
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame.	48.84221649169922
he takes them now for people of
fashion."	73.65420532226562
"i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london.	44.70859909057617
she remembered also, that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr
darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	60.437896728515625
you must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say.	49.9029541015625
"i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."	38.53767395019531
i am very glad
you liked her.	60.114898681640625
mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	44.674598693847656
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	35.492042541503906
his sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	50.68523406982422
one must speak a little, you know.	57.759246826171875
"_that_ is a failing indeed!"	33.08724594116211
nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	65.41539001464844
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	48.99750518798828
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	36.10212326049805
i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	66.85675811767578
"he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	32.3609619140625
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.	37.99668502807617
it became her turn to listen.	37.46719741821289
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	35.10029983520508
your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."	39.3194580078125
that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	38.9537467956543
elizabeth felt jane's
pleasure.	44.86580276489258
but perhaps mr bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."	37.757041931152344
let me hear
     from you very soon.	38.90300750732422
miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	44.768470764160156
my kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till i am better.	85.90735626220703
i must confess myself
     surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.	32.65229034423828
though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was
her, i would not have put up with it.	35.02217483520508
they came.	48.40676498413086
thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
assure you there are many amiable young women.	37.7202033996582
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	62.663204193115234
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	39.18315887451172
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	196.9116973876953
mr darcy!--and so it does i vow.	88.76737213134766
she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	18.958126068115234
what do i not
owe you!	49.08891677856445
"hate you!	16.924636840820312
how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!	39.736473083496094
elizabeth, equally
next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	43.390357971191406
special rules,
set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark.	80.53358459472656
he has heartily forgiven me
now."	50.031028747558594
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.	69.71348571777344
1.e.4.	50.05525207519531
as a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him!	60.08881759643555
"this is an evening of wonders, indeed!	38.48152542114258
"how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!	105.08032989501953
and then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.	41.98275375366211
but that is not the
case _here_.	29.99646759033203
he is come--mr bingley is
come.--he is, indeed.	46.51895523071289
"did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	47.75859069824219
my aunt told me so
herself on saturday.	24.73636817932129
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	38.664581298828125
"but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."	39.57720184326172
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him."	29.35453987121582
mrs bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
mr bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	44.06016159057617
darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
consented.	34.36240005493164
the fee is
     owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     project gutenberg literary archive foundation.	80.58617401123047
it is impossible that he should still love
me."	40.51011657714844
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."	8.891507148742676
the distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	76.5828857421875
"i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.	40.77095031738281
poor dear
child!	26.313730239868164
no thanks to his gallantry for that.	38.65459060668945
four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	40.66496658325195
mrs gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	53.26533889770508
"certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	23.071704864501953
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
we shall do."	38.14996337890625
"a man who has once been refused!	28.330482482910156
you may depend upon my seeking no further."	59.93229675292969
that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	20.088871002197266
the foundation's principal office is located at 4557 melan dr. s.
fairbanks, ak, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.	41.066017150878906
the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	22.901533126831055
by nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at st. james's had made him
courteous.	29.237384796142578
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	29.414079666137695
there are a few
things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	47.94674301147461
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	33.399505615234375
my sister, i am
sure, will not hear of her removal."	40.72698974609375
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister!	78.4976806640625
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.	52.10546875
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.	31.999710083007812
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	43.31504440307617
and
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	48.479286193847656
said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with."	38.66093444824219
but jane and elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	49.01664733886719
"our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."	59.13824462890625
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.	58.18098831176758
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard."	39.96617126464844
if you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	48.8117561340332
"my dear sir," replied mr collins, "i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	61.7793083190918
wont it, kitty?"	38.32060623168945
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from caroline.	35.674400329589844
"oh, yes!--he was to come there with wickham, you know.	41.78384017944336
your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--if it be so, if i have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.	95.21678161621094
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	18.711145401000977
kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; by the bye, mrs forster and me are _such_ friends!	31.645376205444336
"i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a
kingdom!	19.608457565307617
cried miss bingley.	30.26505470275879
ring the bell,
kitty, for hill.	28.926944732666016
but you are always giving _her_ the
preference."	51.55339431762695
"yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	46.52375030517578
"already arisen!"	18.831857681274414
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	33.05924987792969
they had frequently been staying with her in town.	54.70376968383789
does he
know his real character?"	38.180511474609375
"yes--if darcy does not put it off again.	47.653602600097656
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as i certainly did."	60.51726150512695
her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	27.067472457885742
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	44.042259216308594
is not it so, mrs bennet?"	194.51377868652344
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"	58.579647064208984
she had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.	41.96928024291992
what news?	28.113210678100586
only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	45.99140167236328
"as soon as ever mr bingley comes, my dear," said mrs bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."	18.287555694580078
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- you pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of project gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.	39.138648986816406
every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.	48.178253173828125
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king.	29.637975692749023
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.	69.75978088378906
"i have, sir."	29.428804397583008
"i am sure i shall break _mine_," said lydia.	65.22225189208984
and with no one to speak to, of what i
felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had!	27.233041763305664
what
could be more natural than his asking you again?	49.353492736816406
these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	41.2501106262207
"pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."	42.00245666503906
she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	80.10616302490234
he had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	64.84745025634766
"your affectionate friend,

     "lydia bennet."	44.16331481933594
mrs wickham!	36.88594055175781
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	25.471824645996094
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without
calling her attention.	36.568321228027344
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	47.372772216796875
take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.	51.561058044433594
they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."	77.89208221435547
"you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.	41.504512786865234
you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	51.55509567260742
"i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.	49.055057525634766
her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	36.590675354003906
he who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	31.656494140625
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	35.525760650634766
and this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace.	93.33233642578125
i think i have heard you say that you know them."	33.9317512512207
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for jane.	65.19261932373047
so much the better.	49.62553405761719
and what can _he_ have to say?"	24.39923095703125
that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	32.04652786254883
i have no such injuries to resent.	132.3256378173828
in three volumes.	42.94042205810547
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."	38.828800201416016
i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!	39.43010330200195
miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr darcy looked
up.	40.60649490356445
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	43.89975357055664
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	62.83219528198242
"indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	75.92469024658203
"my dear mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	46.68170166015625
"aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had
known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	58.22966766357422
and do you
really love him quite well enough?	24.645341873168945
mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	55.93047332763672
and so extremely
accomplished for her age!	44.86896896362305
"yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside."	31.311038970947266
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins,
and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy."	29.788698196411133
elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.	65.78240203857422
mr collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	29.957622528076172
i
hope he will overlook it.	31.49493408203125
the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	44.5570068359375
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	50.846534729003906
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
together.	35.634029388427734
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers."	40.233253479003906
if there _were_ but
such another man for you!"	39.044803619384766
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once.	20.433202743530273
"aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."	47.77919387817383
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	21.110254287719727
--a
short pause followed this speech, and mrs hurst began again.	61.64042282104492
she resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	33.941402435302734
how shall i bear so much happiness!"	46.035743713378906
i
shall now know how to act.	86.5278549194336
her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.	17.966100692749023
elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.	16.78169822692871
"had you then persuaded yourself that i should?"	29.96207618713379
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	44.008018493652344
"and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."	19.52427864074707
you will be a very happy woman."	55.81431198120117
but against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	47.61842346191406
"is it possible!"	38.627601623535156
he was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	49.28031921386719
how could i
     be so silly as to wish it!	50.013427734375
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.	48.2186279296875
"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr darcy!--there
is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."	72.48416900634766
charlotte the wife of mr collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	33.20967483520508
"it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	70.2086181640625
it was a rational scheme to be sure!	44.225643157958984
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	2.7370657920837402
i quite detest the man."	22.68512725830078
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance.	40.87681198120117
oh!	60.39857482910156
this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."	27.56156349182129
mr bennet could not have chosen
better.	34.71940231323242
my dear jane, i am in
such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you
write for me.	51.045631408691406
"yes; he introduced us to his sister."	49.785423278808594
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	67.48240661621094
"i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful."	28.793909072875977
i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."	46.28736877441406
the period of expectation was now doubled.	31.43610954284668
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	7.245738506317139
lady catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr
darcy.	40.48491287231445

you
mentioned _two_ instances.	34.344364166259766
and if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	59.71973419189453
"john told us mr darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	58.530643463134766
but no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	36.6938591003418
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	74.66761779785156
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	55.85565948486328
but i must tell you how it went off.	49.97734451293945
i wish you had been there.	47.38555145263672
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	38.76624298095703
she turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	21.815296173095703
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	48.75874710083008
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	42.892574310302734
"certainly not."	40.900150299072266
elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	42.0787239074707
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady
catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	39.435462951660156
"no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.	59.18169021606445
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	41.79350280761719
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,"
said he.	67.30696868896484
her own thoughts were employing her.	52.363285064697266
it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	28.364463806152344
"project gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	54.14535903930664
now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

"mr darcy, i am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding your's.	39.76930236816406
let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	40.522884368896484
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me.	47.584171295166016
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear.	34.660457611083984
as to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.	66.63272094726562
she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	123.15528869628906
"i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley's conduct to design,"
said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	28.21268653869629
"certainly.	41.10478591918945
1813.	41.48411560058594
what is it you are talking
of?	54.063114166259766
recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	43.52685546875
i have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, i should think you could not do better.	80.53358459472656
"to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding, than i now do of her heart.	16.16461181640625
my dear brother," replied mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i
could most wish for.	44.482513427734375
i am not qualified to form one.	35.84376907348633
1.f.5.	57.7160758972168
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter.	46.033058166503906
it is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."	15.066788673400879
my dear, dear
lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!"	35.87950897216797
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did.	25.85405921936035
"mrs annesley is with her.	60.08449172973633
a thousand things may arise in six months!"	49.1470947265625
i know how much
you dislike him."	20.938459396362305
very well.	44.36240768432617
"how i long to see her again!	28.926799774169922
he sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	35.43860626220703
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	54.99565124511719
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	38.32720184326172
it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."	47.430599212646484
at last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with
great perseverance.	150.21725463867188
my poor father!	28.959102630615234
but with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
chance of it."	33.68902587890625
when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	53.60295104980469
elizabeth could not but look surprised.	51.97340774536133
in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.	48.49946975708008
but i know the
foundation is unjust.	25.707279205322266
"oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"	81.5027847290039
"a great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	42.21369552612305
they are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."	47.88771438598633
this
unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at pemberley to-day."	168.49937438964844
"well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.	44.32451629638672
she began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	44.63658905029297
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	97.54846954345703
"no, no.	40.03592300415039
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said
elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	53.17326736450195
she wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country."	37.900794982910156
"that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	89.36279296875
"i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."	32.691314697265625
to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	17.847902297973633
it drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	64.9461669921875
"true.	63.412654876708984
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."	29.90654945373535
will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"	38.60981369018555
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	29.67743682861328
_too
much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	17.61681365966797
elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.	41.84282684326172
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	52.680423736572266
"what can be the meaning of this!"	49.49691390991211
elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	61.53288650512695
lady catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	45.48125076293945
at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!	34.66463088989258
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	28.491430282592773
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	79.41806030273438
"indeed, mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"	41.81037521362305
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	34.09127426147461
but i must write no more.	32.096588134765625
not that
i care about it, though.	57.565460205078125
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "mr bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	42.90685272216797
assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	40.71538162231445
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	93.51185607910156
"he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	70.36966705322266
the two youngest of the family,
catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.	34.94021987915039
darcy,
as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	82.22744750976562
who should suffer but myself?	52.689388275146484
"this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said
elizabeth.	66.71977996826172
"i never can be thankful, mr bennet, for any thing about the entail.	33.81038284301758
but think no more of the letter.	57.996620178222656
however, i did not hear above one word in ten,
for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.	49.07902145385742
this is my advice.	20.687320709228516
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	46.07143020629883
they could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for mr darcy.	40.567562103271484
i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	33.679595947265625
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity.	55.23630905151367
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	54.80447006225586
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.	104.45207214355469
lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.	35.70154571533203
but really, and upon my
honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you
are satisfied."	70.11798858642578
there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	63.680397033691406
it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	9.541034698486328
but every body is to
judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i
assure you.	42.65900802612305
with the kindest concern he
     came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart.	40.952938079833984
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	37.311134338378906
--cried elizabeth.	48.889347076416016
"how nicely we are crammed in!"	42.062843322753906
"well, and what news does it bring?	29.34132194519043
"yes, yes, they must marry.	31.790498733520508
follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, i own, and i
laugh at them whenever i can.--but these, i suppose, are precisely what
you are without."	61.16747283935547
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	41.419952392578125
are any of your
younger sisters out, miss bennet?"	44.8139762878418
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn, before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals.	28.97516632080078
"no, she would go home.	24.235706329345703
elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	48.60533142089844
i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.	32.90715026855469

i see the imprudence
of it.--oh!	37.224483489990234
if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	48.60184097290039
balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	38.08665466308594
they have some of the finest woods in the
country."	38.731422424316406
as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	30.308313369750977
the very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	52.59906005859375
arguments are too much like disputes.	54.242923736572266
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."	44.66688919067383
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	34.195823669433594
but it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."	75.63265991210938
they repulsed
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr collins, who was complimenting mr bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	35.98759078979492
elizabeth could bear it no longer.	51.67575454711914
"he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam.	49.52730941772461
"nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair.	51.105690002441406
"you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	24.502946853637695
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."	37.85863494873047
"with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it."	43.49000930786133
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire.	43.583988189697266

so
genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every
body.--_that_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."	45.103031158447266
it soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	23.529739379882812
"and they are really to be married!"	42.69868087768555
it was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	37.66510009765625
her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	36.497093200683594
vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!	49.02752685546875
"my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."	46.54657745361328
teazing, teazing, man!	43.23952102661133
how much you
must have gone through!"	44.108219146728516
while in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family!	53.21278762817383
darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right.	44.11848449707031
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth.	49.890342712402344
"is my father in town?"	37.133758544921875
she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	55.39256286621094
said miss bingley; "will
she be as tall as i am?"	41.00211715698242
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	37.21461868286133
he was silent.	43.975013732910156
he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.	33.31642532348633
there is a lady, it seems, a
     mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.	37.58121871948242
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"	38.390716552734375
tell him i hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	51.06824493408203
i do not deserve it.	48.4965934753418
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness."	32.388099670410156
occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.	92.1897964477539
i am prodigiously proud of him.	62.7883186340332
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	48.31296920776367
oh, that i knew how it was!"	38.85904312133789
"of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	45.17720413208008
"no, i should have turned in a moment."	41.41574478149414
it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	19.743974685668945
but not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	62.69614028930664
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	100.43180084228516
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
jane certainly could not come back.	37.99016189575195
you see how continually we are engaged there.	65.71583557128906
i have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--not that i have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.	42.933876037597656
all field sports were over.	68.50762176513672
"my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request.	50.17461395263672
she cried.--"i, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--i, who have valued myself on my abilities!	40.65914535522461
she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr collins
instead!	29.449140548706055
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	38.54604721069336
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	13.028411865234375
"my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	50.83000564575195
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.	46.28863525390625
supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin?	51.39820861816406
women fancy admiration means more than
it does."	22.740676879882812
she could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	24.729928970336914
it is evident that you belong to the
first circles.	33.120731353759766
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall i own that i long for your return?	51.1893310546875
kitty, run down and order the carriage.	62.18478012084961
"but how did he account for
it?"	57.202571868896484
the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	39.89237976074219
what do
you keep winking at me for?	31.908061981201172
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	51.86890411376953
i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.	30.17034149169922
"lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	36.8231201171875
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	57.60785675048828
"but it is," returned she; "for mrs long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."	38.334163665771484
"mr
collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	62.46437072753906
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	25.6041202545166
for
     about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation.	37.53425979614258
she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	33.62769317626953
the supposition did not pain her.	42.42347717285156
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam.	56.115196228027344
"now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said mr bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	51.9132080078125
his belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	36.722442626953125
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	78.05020904541016
elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	44.537513732910156
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	35.36766815185547
but do you
always write such charming long letters to her, mr darcy?"	34.6384162902832
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley.	65.65238189697266
i _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.	44.58573913574219
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation "the foundation"
or pglaf, owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project
gutenberg-tm electronic works.	27.927188873291016
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	39.57872009277344
do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	57.98924255371094
"my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london."	32.8037109375
"i hope not."	47.22198486328125
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.	43.88311004638672
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton.	49.142433166503906
the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield.	39.12699508666992
the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	88.65311431884766
it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	31.39383888244629
elizabeth was distressed.	49.01616287231445
with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise
full.--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	47.46800231933594
you know i have.	46.365753173828125
"his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."	50.1767463684082
"aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."	36.714229583740234
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth:

     "my dearest lizzy,

     "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	27.18486785888672
they found mr bennet still up.	47.48727035522461
his pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."	52.082210540771484
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.	62.650150299072266
then addressing her daughter, "oh!	37.0125846862793
the more i see
of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	34.20446014404297
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	45.112091064453125
the insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would
i give to hear your strictures on them!"	35.464473724365234
"i am
sorry it went off.	56.574684143066406
"and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me!	27.92755699157715
could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	41.50675964355469
she was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	51.98031997680664
"haye-park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
too far off!	49.908164978027344
you shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	39.85627365112305
i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_.	73.11724090576172
and even mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.	61.31543731689453
it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	30.473400115966797
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	41.70140075683594
"oh!	40.20901870727539
they were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something!	26.44114112854004
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	43.84957504272461
but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	36.95772171020508
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and
the children.	53.833431243896484
elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	26.013103485107422
he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
lucases.	42.43088912963867
--it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	74.45926666259766
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.	54.5924072265625
it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	39.82299041748047
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."	39.8460807800293
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	42.501224517822266
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him."	56.080238342285156
"really, mr collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	36.39595413208008
that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	17.344022750854492
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	29.659873962402344
"my dear niece,

     "i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as i foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what i have to tell you.	47.47212219238281
colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr darcy they had
only seen at church.	34.33124923706055
is nothing due to me on that
score?	49.04436492919922
sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	67.2708740234375
mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	32.12649917602539
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	42.31613540649414
mr collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library, he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him, and
lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose fordyce's sermons.	45.37991714477539
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both.	26.89552879333496
"i dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	53.269676208496094
"this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	72.6536865234375
limited right of replacement or refund - if you discover a

receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a

when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	36.62281036376953
his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	17.98166275024414
i
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, i am thus rejected.	26.271347045898438
it is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
     think of us.	19.01803207397461
those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."	69.19792175292969
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy.	45.59790802001953
he seldom appeared really
animated.	34.613426208496094
but it is of small importance."	45.1877326965332
what an agreeable man sir
william is, mr bingley--is not he?	73.69415283203125
he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	41.25043869018555
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"	55.474788665771484
"if your master would marry, you might see more of him."	32.871864318847656
my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	35.136436462402344
mr darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	42.21080780029297
i was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	54.2597770690918
--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	51.56801986694336
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country.	54.05131912231445
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"	30.977914810180664
what a contrast between him and his friend!	33.88494873046875
only look at her.	55.10771560668945
but little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	28.34595489501953
"yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	2.7370657920837402
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose.	39.896873474121094
they shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	24.935039520263672
what are you telling miss bennet?	27.1868839263916
oh!	54.24984359741211
"having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	23.74429702758789
cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?"	35.315608978271484
"you look pale.	26.598358154296875
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	73.75546264648438
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.	41.734474182128906
poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	51.17591857910156
she went on.	78.12210083007812
i
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes.	29.320615768432617
if there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
miss de bourgh.	61.216552734375
but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is.	42.58158493041992
she was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.	46.937496185302734
"mr darcy!"	52.718658447265625
the moral will be perfectly fair.	37.29767608642578
she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."	52.87215042114258
"upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	58.00555419921875
he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.	45.04703903198242
as her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	45.912803649902344
she
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	68.98552703857422
"beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	35.417762756347656
"i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	35.318626403808594
for forty years, he produced and distributed project
gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	45.35604476928711
"you are mistaken.	34.01921463012695
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	43.11411666870117
mr
darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	53.23128890991211
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	32.007843017578125
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	25.10560417175293
the
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	39.36167907714844
almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	80.18094635009766
they were off saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight.	36.382179260253906
we seem to have been designed for each
other."	36.925846099853516
i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	24.609315872192383
such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	45.32478332519531
as the day of his arrival drew near,

"i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister.	37.131343841552734
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that mr darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself.	35.96651077270508
we acted with the best intentions."	40.47410583496094
"i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	46.09021759033203
"i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, "_i_ can
hardly be just to him."	56.75942611694336
conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long."	28.303632736206055
our situation
with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	17.05838394165039
mrs hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	30.516477584838867
but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.	23.597793579101562
he confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	21.24349594116211
did you see it?"	31.485483169555664
but in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair.	38.94951248168945
elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	47.42790222167969
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn-house.	39.52393341064453
she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	47.23276901245117
"i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	43.901222229003906
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	72.7474594116211
"she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	48.39284133911133
his coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.	40.93826675415039
if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it."	50.5184440612793
"the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	33.70315933227539
i expected
you to stay two months.	24.51331329345703
then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	30.025148391723633
"and what is your success?"	54.441829681396484
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs
bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	56.692230224609375
"very much."	14.73849868774414
there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	27.476001739501953
he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	2.8924403190612793
she was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	23.420045852661133
"can you come to-morrow?"	28.38532829284668
if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	83.45024871826172
lord!	43.7193489074707
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton.	31.76619529724121
"how can you be smiling so,
lizzy?"	50.57575607299805
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	48.5916748046875
sir, i do indeed.	36.70497131347656
my aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing."	35.38296890258789
of having another daughter married to mr collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	46.22917556762695
we have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	56.71916580200195
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	46.34764099121094
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	17.78528594970703
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	41.92338943481445
he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there.	36.702274322509766
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued
absence.	70.04012298583984
"did charlotte dine with you?"	34.160133361816406
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	30.492563247680664
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.	42.39964294433594
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	48.096351623535156
the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	60.53227233886719
there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."	62.729305267333984
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield
because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him.	42.511959075927734
but mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	50.30191421508789
elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	38.18840408325195
one ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!	55.35704803466797
but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	31.450632095336914
my dear hill, have you
heard the good news?	90.23506927490234
"but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king?	26.050411224365234
sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	58.07826232910156
well, my comfort is, i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."	45.38679885864258
the
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.	50.93098068237305
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"	123.21501922607422
lydia's being settled in the
north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	32.590721130371094
her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	50.49586486816406
--she could have added, "a young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
manner!"	61.9652099609375
i quite forgot!	26.38745880126953
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton.	27.632427215576172
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	23.219152450561523
as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	34.62556076049805
mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	46.050960540771484
"never, sir."	39.5464973449707
the party did not supply much conversation.	44.001312255859375
you have delighted us long enough.	34.06852722167969
and gravely glancing
at mr darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i
shall keep mine to swell my song."	50.40484619140625
"you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	23.056215286254883
their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	56.337646484375
"yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it?"	2.417210102081299
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	73.11724090576172
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.	35.29573440551758
its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	29.786914825439453
thank god!	43.35726547241211
"oh!	50.23276138305664

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.	41.12518310546875
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.	32.64426803588867
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation
and you!	44.59726333618164
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	57.63179016113281
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	36.49369812011719
elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord,
how tired i am!"	32.79402160644531
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of mr darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	49.54816818237305
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	40.44688034057617
whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.	47.69108963012695
"certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can
dance."	52.4613151550293
"no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	67.39403533935547
"if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	50.859500885009766
she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	40.029815673828125
she talked to elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	39.29423141479492
upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.	15.787846565246582
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	33.230979919433594
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as mr gardiner could do.	56.170989990234375
perhaps i am not doing her justice.	44.391761779785156
mr wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return.	47.639442443847656
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	28.659486770629883
the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	64.71150970458984
they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	45.84541702270508
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	35.62405776977539
i am so
pleased--so happy.	29.040908813476562
though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	35.24666213989258
"sir, you quite misunderstand me," said mrs bennet, alarmed.	11.013358116149902
if you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	24.763755798339844
she practises very constantly."	43.96156311035156
cried
jane.	35.58207321166992
"oh!"	73.11724090576172
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.	44.53110122680664
your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	36.2647819519043
"oh!	53.2031364440918
and with a bow to mr darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many
stared.--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	39.71196746826172
said she.	41.3015022277832
she dreaded seeing wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	37.50510025024414
i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."	36.89878463745117
the
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	37.72684860229492
there, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	40.15949249267578
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!	39.8895378112793
allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza, glancing
at her sister and bingley, shall take place.	45.34284210205078
his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	44.82911682128906
they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	59.83326721191406
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs
collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	71.17068481445312
as to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	40.18766784667969
elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	66.84782409667969
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	21.205238342285156
"who do you mean, my dear?	86.6852798461914
he was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	40.79427719116211
"your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.	34.285770416259766
"did not you?	47.74433898925781
"i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception.	33.95827102661133
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.	47.993900299072266
we can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	56.63787078857422
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	50.985836029052734
"i do not know when i have been more shocked," said she.	46.07898712158203
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married.	16.100648880004883
"merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.	37.55995178222656
she opened the
door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"oh, my dear eliza!	40.91386032104492
we have heard nothing from town."	39.328433990478516
i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."	68.0986099243164
after an affectionate
parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to mr and mrs gardiner, though unknown.	44.816070556640625
i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     william collins."	36.68550491333008
but it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	43.14363479614258
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here?	36.44599914550781
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as
to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.	61.67743682861328
by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	37.70167922973633
his
friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
ten days time.	43.367340087890625
who could have done less for her?	48.15238952636719
lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	39.522857666015625
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.	22.894752502441406
she is almost three and twenty!	73.89690399169922
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	42.727508544921875
added elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."	118.32664489746094
send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly.	23.82691192626953
she saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."	45.19939041137695
"indeed i had.	49.84571075439453
i can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_i_ have seen nothing of it."	42.47563934326172
"good gracious!	27.847190856933594
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	39.482696533203125
mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	45.61164093017578
every body said how well
she looked; and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	39.82508850097656
after a short silence, the lady first spoke.	36.39272689819336
mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.	32.18229293823242
but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	53.80866622924805
that had
his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as mr bingley, was incomprehensible.	33.3173942565918
"i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	48.49827194213867
mr darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	40.90383529663086
"you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."	42.90084457397461
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	44.49009704589844
they were in ----
     street.	37.52727127075195
he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	37.02386474609375
no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	68.1565933227539
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	53.2949333190918
after discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	98.54902648925781
she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	32.66105651855469
"not as you represent it.	42.25580978393555
but, really, i know not what to say.	41.43067169189453
you know i always
speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	73.11724090576172
nonsense, how can you talk so!	14.38329029083252
when she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr
darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining mr bingley for his sister.	41.9098014831543
"oh!	116.74433898925781
gardiner."	65.57196807861328
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.	44.4072380065918
i came to you without a
doubt of my reception.	29.673107147216797
she had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	44.51029586791992
"your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	43.293304443359375
"my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else!	43.49428176879883
he added, that mr
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and
promised to write again very soon.	44.643104553222656
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	38.78431701660156
if i was to go through the world, i could not
meet with a better.	47.8932991027832
jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.	54.44615173339844
this must be the grossest falsehood!"	72.44615936279297
well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	27.4576416015625
"and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."	45.294525146484375
"what would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?"	68.49151611328125
"in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	43.1933708190918
'lady
catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'	52.26423263549805
"yes; to the last.	34.45869445800781
but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.	39.544029235839844
observed mrs bennet.	48.843441009521484
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more."	71.08660125732422
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	38.57528305053711
he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.	30.75876235961914
elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.	44.98065185546875
your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.	69.31433868408203
i am sick of them all.	62.794158935546875
i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	34.439064025878906
"you appear to me, mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.	45.72686004638672
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	52.15068435668945
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when mr hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	48.931312561035156
if your
feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.	31.083391189575195
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	26.868391036987305
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	42.88200378417969
he made no answer.	32.515968322753906
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in paragraph 1.f.3.	73.66474914550781
in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	36.928428649902344
but i am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--they were excessively sorry to go!	34.52224349975586
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.	39.555938720703125
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	40.38164138793945
"good heavens!"	35.29079818725586
but
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	33.08975601196289
at first there
seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	39.536617279052734
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be very tolerable.	64.63656616210938
jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	32.33951950073242
miss darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	39.480804443359375
i came to try you.	61.777427673339844
"if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	34.78852462768555
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	31.143293380737305
at length the parsonage was discernible.	11.409260749816895
"except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate."	59.918094635009766
let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	108.72681427001953
yes.	27.44691276550293
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	30.20054054260254
but does not jane
correspond with the sister?	117.29110717773438
mr darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding.	35.34039306640625
from that moment i
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then
     perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had
     ever witnessed in him.	34.48273849487305
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?	76.34712982177734
we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	144.30506896972656
they were of a respectable family in
the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	41.232086181640625
the express was sent off directly.	107.7442626953125
but enough of this.	40.066776275634766
but, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	33.043495178222656
and is it really true?	27.318782806396484
their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	44.31817626953125
this, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
were not decidedly better.	53.35163497924805
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.	17.916887283325195
to be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he
_did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
about mr robinson."	36.357879638671875
the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."	38.68474197387695
"and what arts did he use to separate them?"	31.164928436279297
i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."	54.39468002319336
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	36.508506774902344
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	29.615215301513672
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	35.53208923339844
to persuade him against
     returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.	22.09568214416504
it would have suited
me in every respect."	60.285667419433594
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	44.682064056396484
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	50.16367721557617
their manners are not equal to his."	16.17949676513672
in
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	29.444799423217773
he
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	26.768962860107422
and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in
debt; but i hope this may be false."	27.121191024780273
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	87.51204681396484
"you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth.	39.60987091064453
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	52.34006881713867
but do not be cast down.	59.13252258300781
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	35.64372253417969
i have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	37.69352340698242
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.	47.435455322265625
it is a pity they are not handsome!	38.93721008300781
they can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."	34.13371658325195
"elizabeth, you are not serious now."	201.374755859375
i thought
we never should have got into the coach.	25.852523803710938
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	22.673831939697266
"and quite alone?	38.23114776611328
shall you like to have such a brother?"	31.78219223022461
may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"	54.442710876464844
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	36.008026123046875
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	52.78999328613281
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."	48.60067367553711
while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at st. james's.	49.29399871826172
elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.	55.30340576171875
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	45.370723724365234
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	39.863162994384766
"there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	52.934391021728516
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	15.911356925964355
"yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	14.38329029083252
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	36.48966598510742
mrs bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	43.334190368652344
gardiner."	33.718570709228516
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.	40.65121078491211
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	41.76423645019531
she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet.	40.912200927734375
if i had ever learnt, i
should have been a great proficient.	82.34861755371094
i am sincerely grieved for him and
     mrs f. but no one can throw any blame on them.	64.61897277832031
"not so much as i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his
time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months."	9.977254867553711
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	16.234716415405273
"nor i, i am sure," said miss bingley.	43.077980041503906
i should infinitely prefer a book."	43.33403396606445
"such as vanity and pride."	45.15919876098633
"compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	37.34716796875
my dear mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	28.82344627380371
"but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.	33.34588623046875
"i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	41.944244384765625
i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."	31.914596557617188
she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.	42.546390533447266
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.	37.15030288696289
"i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	42.409523010253906
besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."	97.37915802001953
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	44.24544143676758
"something very much to the purpose of course.	36.505184173583984
who would
have thought it!	47.14302062988281
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	32.7043571472168
mr bingley and jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.	30.431276321411133
"i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	52.9983024597168
- you provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.	97.25828552246094
darcy said
nothing at all.	30.333881378173828
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.	21.670116424560547
"of whom does jane ever think ill?	48.28089904785156
you will hardly bear to be
long outdone by jane.	37.905601501464844
what will become of me.	48.248233795166016
his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."	27.021568298339844
"it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth.	60.60753631591797
elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	80.53358459472656
to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh?	40.3429069519043
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."	62.28285217285156
1.f.2.	45.25126647949219
a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.	43.643856048583984
the
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness!	30.63821029663086
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence; mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	53.228431701660156
mrs gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	53.30458068847656
but it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."	49.81986999511719
"indeed you are mistaken.	121.45783996582031
what made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	40.947021484375
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	36.64385986328125
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.	41.707786560058594
at length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	52.869651794433594
their reception from mr bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	36.31452178955078
every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	53.085323333740234
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
bingley.	17.2072696685791
i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	49.80354690551758
mr
hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	44.96552276611328
could there be
finer symptoms?	40.52977752685547
she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.	33.12348175048828
"not one."	50.60870361328125
my excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant.	46.56008529663086
"yes," thought elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.	42.327457427978516
rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	47.02109909057617
when you told mrs
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	60.88920974731445
"that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	57.60145568847656
at such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	52.551841735839844
what has she to do with it?	19.968368530273438
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."	55.75642776489258
he had been some time with mr gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning.	29.004976272583008
do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."	48.868431091308594
in another minute mr bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	28.617746353149414
he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	18.403772354125977
"would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	24.763755798339844
console lady catherine as well as
     you can.	52.32750701904297
can copy and distribute it in the united states without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.	45.70504379272461
"oh!"	49.468994140625
that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."	24.153364181518555
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	48.10354232788086
his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	20.859830856323242
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
i assure you.	51.48038864135742
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	38.46064758300781
"you used us abominably ill," answered mrs hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."	27.161083221435547
"on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession
to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.	28.71175193786621
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	110.91726684570312
"would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	42.43941879272461
elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	44.489322662353516
what hours of transport we shall spend!	37.0429573059082
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.	55.432167053222656
there was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	34.93034362792969
"but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"	33.368099212646484
without a governess you must
have been neglected."	50.40547180175781
elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	31.52486228942871
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you
say that he was at rosings?"	26.242244720458984
they all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.	50.09929275512695
elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	38.87800598144531
the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	44.190670013427734
and when i returned home, the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	43.371883392333984
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
discourage him."	41.73321533203125
how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you."	103.6960220336914
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming.	40.66289138793945
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	52.7784538269043
it is of no consequence.	33.61726760864258
i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	39.801673889160156
and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"the men shan't come and part us, i am determined.	34.61398696899414
"eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it
succeeds.	44.60123825073242
"most willingly."	39.707088470458984
"it keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express."	13.400206565856934
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings.	59.59786605834961
when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	45.777706146240234
"_her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	36.130733489990234
i am glad he dines here on tuesday.	46.51008224487305
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	50.52083969116211
he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	41.74790954589844
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	3.778691291809082
first of all, he asked miss lucas.	40.25412368774414
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
ill at netherfield?"	49.53980255126953
1.f.3.	10.883522987365723
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you
will be satisfied with what i have done.	36.96330642700195
i know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.	40.65803146362305
good gracious!	25.08051872253418
"no; but it must be done soon."	48.920875549316406
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	50.681884765625
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist mr wickham with money."	13.747329711914062
"a little."	50.19713592529297
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	33.39717102050781
yet he is _such_ a man!"	26.622102737426758
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and mr collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs philips.--the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.	17.31239128112793
--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could
not hesitate."	37.553436279296875
but it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."	12.679633140563965
i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	33.14214324951172
she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	62.7347526550293
her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."	30.484661102294922
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?"	26.51367950439453
kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.	23.485214233398438
oh, lydia!"	46.14696502685547
you must learn some
of my philosophy.	16.78600311279297
the dejection was almost
universal.	41.48305892944336
she has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne's.	32.95196533203125
on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	38.940486907958984
he walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; charlotte tried to console her.	25.867206573486328
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	22.923131942749023
"write to me very often, my dear."	40.29490280151367
our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia's character.	45.58772277832031
we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	17.366994857788086
i dare say i shall
soon see them here."	84.40567779541016
it was
unpardonable.	47.28216552734375
you never see a fault in any body.	33.95247268676758
"oh, yes!--if one could but go to brighton!	40.908485412597656
it is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	39.09730529785156
"but upon my honour i do _not_.	36.01670837402344
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	49.62523651123047
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	42.0890998840332
you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	50.23381423950195
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	29.267662048339844
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	37.745994567871094
to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	58.19865798950195
mr bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	29.241039276123047
said she, as she looked in
her face.	39.727535247802734
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	24.27159309387207
his own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited.	38.229732513427734
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to darcy,

"miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master.	21.20801544189453

the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	48.187660217285156
said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam.	40.080421447753906
you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at pemberley with you."	24.801132202148438
hang kitty!	17.042095184326172
they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	31.59286117553711
"at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said mr bennet, as he folded up the letter.	54.86612319946289
miss bennet still looked all amazement.	33.72999572753906
elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention!	50.55234909057617
it was as
follows:

     "my dear sir,

     "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from hertfordshire.	57.21610641479492
mr collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	39.37464904785156
for, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	137.19247436523438
he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.	30.15094757080078
"but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."	37.66930389404297
"oh, well!	75.07225036621094
"now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to
table.	137.70828247070312
oh,
lord!	48.92902374267578
mr wickham began the subject himself.	29.142333984375
"it must not be thought of.	42.28498077392578
till i was in kent, and saw
so much both of mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth myself.	27.17291259765625
why should they try to influence him?	30.420045852661133
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	25.237117767333984
bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	38.765377044677734
she is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
i will _make_ her know it."	36.33324432373047
elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	38.75923156738281
"i should be sorry indeed, if it were.	46.197242736816406
where is your sash my dear?"	45.10085678100586
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.	126.1358413696289
the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	41.463993072509766
elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	56.183712005615234
"and i certainly _never_ shall give it.	42.11130905151367
"then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
mr bingley to _her_."	15.447600364685059
how i wanted you!"	37.71224594116211
it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	36.744659423828125
thus, we do not necessarily
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	31.917314529418945
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	48.88130187988281
mrs hurst
thought the same, and added,

"she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	39.64683151245117
my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"	48.3648567199707
louisa and i were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."	42.97982406616211
it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr collins joining
in, observed,

"yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
be delighted with her.	31.34833335876465
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.	28.637493133544922
"i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want."	36.646236419677734
when they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be
soon married to mr bingley.--it was an animating subject, and mrs
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	49.894840240478516
she
looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	34.9352912902832
"i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton."	36.96343231201172
"very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.	46.444183349609375
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	30.04665184020996
it
was all pride and insolence.	37.946502685546875
"perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	34.87697219848633
as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	53.08634567260742
cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."	44.50812530517578
she
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	38.91152572631836
"of mr collins and lizzy.	47.6950569152832
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."	49.34252166748047
"i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	47.96492385864258
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.	45.10863494873047
_that_ is all to be forgot.	50.830997467041016
they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	36.124671936035156
it is just as he chooses.	12.06506633758545
soon after
     you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of london they were.	45.82426452636719
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	40.44319152832031
i write rather slowly."	20.734703063964844
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.	30.510147094726562
cried elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--how could
his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress?"	61.52762985229492
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	39.447669982910156
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	44.010074615478516
the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	43.32734680175781
they were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.	31.578899383544922
i will not tell you what it is.	202.66635131835938
darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	35.47824478149414
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to
satisfy.	27.85239028930664
"and my mother--how is she?	29.226194381713867
but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	37.876976013183594
the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	53.38283157348633
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."	46.08197784423828
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	39.161964416503906
no,
no--i feel he may defy us there.	48.47505569458008
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	28.4808292388916
i shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	33.69829559326172
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	15.229178428649902
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	2.7370657920837402
"kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully.	41.32707977294922
1.e.7.	32.2908821105957
oh!	50.6721305847168
what could your ladyship propose by it?"	33.38840866088867
what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?	44.792362213134766
"what, none of you?"	39.70671081542969
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!	31.491735458374023
it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way.	55.584922790527344
"yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	35.56996154785156
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	92.05142974853516
i cannot find
out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	44.657432556152344
"not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."	45.9707145690918
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth!	25.077857971191406
you have liked many a
stupider person."	41.41623306274414
"and this is always the way with him," she added.--"whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	45.799800872802734
to caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit.	39.36934280395508
"your's, &c."

this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	3.0142321586608887
"i should like it beyond any thing!"	52.48186111450195
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	25.3951416015625
then pray speak aloud.	66.05786895751953
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	37.51761245727539
jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	53.50947952270508
"lizzy, you must not do so.	92.26451110839844
i am not at all afraid of her dying.	38.31848907470703
"i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr bennet.	73.08858489990234
i have by no means done.	26.836151123046875
her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"there are very few people of whom so much can be said.	35.790260314941406
"you quite mistook mr darcy.	28.64329719543457
"undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	38.30888366699219
"it must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."	33.22298049926758
there was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	29.928844451904297
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	42.68476867675781
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	44.207950592041016
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	33.15225601196289
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	29.790912628173828
there was one part
especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the
power of reading again.	59.49079895019531
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	22.905933380126953
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	37.42722702026367
but the
clothes, the wedding clothes!	37.58977127075195
it was lady catherine de bourgh.	17.0002498626709
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	87.83814239501953
in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."	35.363224029541016
it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.	48.943843841552734
she has known him only a fortnight.	40.25216293334961
at any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."	39.139190673828125
but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the
trouble of practising.	40.28371810913086
"lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."	30.759817123413086
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	20.36271095275879
there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."	32.85966491699219
but mr gardiner
     could not be seen, and mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning.	36.84089279174805
mr
darcy may hug himself."	47.84141540527344
she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be mr darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	23.043590545654297
but she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	43.8804931640625
she is all affability and condescension, and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	45.81301498413086
i want to be told whether i
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham's character."	33.124778747558594
between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	40.31813049316406
*       *       *       *       *

the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs bennet's curiosity; and
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	26.140539169311523
i ought not to have said a word about it.	50.64253616333008
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins.	45.82350158691406
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
pemberley.	37.3342170715332
little more than half a day's
journey.	43.88691711425781
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	51.70648956298828
he was received by mrs
bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	32.64113235473633
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss
bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	42.39764404296875
pray, how _violent was_ mr bingley's
love?"	52.22163009643555
"if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside," cried bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."	48.467132568359375
"that is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	48.54643630981445
"perhaps that is not possible for any one.	41.67424774169922
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
meet mr darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--yet it did, and even a third.	45.60464859008789
you will find her manners beyond any
thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	33.390594482421875
mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	52.126834869384766
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr darcy!"	29.052154541015625
you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	29.104923248291016
it was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	41.13726806640625
i speak nothing but the truth.	39.350990295410156
and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.	28.60574722290039
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	44.904415130615234
and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."	82.23419952392578
again she read on.	34.59024429321289
but i have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."	100.472900390625
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	37.81256103515625
it is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."	62.6327018737793
next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	26.264846801757812
you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."	73.11724090576172
you were
not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.	45.86782455444336
do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."	39.85204315185547
"oh!	31.677419662475586
"how despicably have i acted!"	50.81879425048828
mr bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	53.89519119262695
allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	34.3596305847168
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	50.55590057373047
"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."	31.337400436401367
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	40.84450912475586
"are they indeed?"	39.24641418457031
on opening the door, she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	34.75216293334961
she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	23.3359432220459
said he,
with a look of doubt.	49.5093879699707
bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
principal object.	63.53553771972656
"i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."	26.3889217376709
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth; but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"oh!	40.543888092041016
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	30.574949264526367
_my_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."	52.32337188720703
mrs
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with mr bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.	37.35736846923828
"is he married or single?"	29.689001083374023
yes, miss
bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	28.986690521240234
he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton.	28.933147430419922
elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	54.01215362548828
"i am talking of possibilities, charles."	31.801589965820312
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	42.17463302612305
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	36.11577606201172
mrs bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	11.553030967712402
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	40.269527435302734
i believe i have now told you every thing.	37.336753845214844
mrs bennet could hardly
contain herself.	22.37682342529297
she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.	22.479480743408203
you know not what you are
about."	64.15087127685547
"yes, very handsome."	38.06647872924805
i will have no reserves from _you_."	22.049108505249023
it was some consolation to
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.	30.47840690612793
i am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but i hardly know what i have written."	22.91534996032715
his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	34.74155807495117
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them.	29.79032325744629
there is
one point, on which i want your advice.	40.490135192871094
his circumstances, he
     assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad.	54.06703186035156
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	38.38493347167969
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.	94.2019271850586
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time.	34.02348327636719
jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	41.25504684448242
and so did mrs
forster.	34.31221389770508
"they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."	39.43950653076172
thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!"	58.216896057128906
elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal."	57.853519439697266
"you judge very properly," said mr bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	11.08838939666748
you must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	73.11724090576172
"and do you impute it to either of those?"	33.01882553100586
cried lydia.	29.01514434814453
"oh!	31.46031379699707
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	65.88030242919922
"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them."	38.683380126953125
"you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short
silence.	38.28529357910156
we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.	42.95316696166992
it was over at last however.	26.8716983795166
mr wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family.	40.376708984375
they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	58.46699523925781
if he _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never
     disgrace him.	34.437496185302734
and tell my dear
lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	56.56996154785156
such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	29.382171630859375
in that case he would return no more.	27.095325469970703
my feelings will not be
repressed.	19.329744338989258
remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."	64.65589904785156
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael
hart, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark.	25.949098587036133
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	28.383100509643555
your tempers are by no means unlike.	54.320152282714844
and in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	71.08795166015625
"you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."	58.87354278564453
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of mr darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	44.57548141479492
"design!	43.0308723449707
her father lifted up his eyes.	37.78030776977539
she was ashamed to think how
much.	51.84079360961914
for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr
darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."	29.616514205932617
and
what do you think she said besides?	28.571910858154297
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	45.31425476074219
i must beg to return to
the house."	54.6535530090332
as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	29.322906494140625
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	21.8946590423584
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield.	65.42967224121094
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

lydia declared herself satisfied.	41.8808708190918
thought elizabeth.	37.78146743774414
his
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	35.81278610229492
she was very
equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	73.11724090576172
his character was decided.	33.63051223754883
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	31.59688377380371
"oh!	25.928003311157227
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	33.54860305786133
"i do not recollect that we did."	38.361228942871094
elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.	23.9299373626709
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	57.39295196533203
on miss lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must."	29.731904983520508
"a great deal of good management, depend upon it.	62.344032287597656
but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.	46.0876579284668
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	27.972532272338867
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.	2.7370657920837402
we have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
     approve.	38.15843200683594
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will
     immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.	35.633480072021484
oh!	71.29108428955078
to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	95.9311294555664
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success.	31.2767391204834
were it for nothing but his love of you, i
must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me.	32.65767288208008
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	64.25382995605469
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"	30.678747177124023
"what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?"	47.48347473144531
but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	55.56729507446289
she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."	44.22874450683594
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	80.6058120727539
"i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	48.797847747802734
it would have been strange if they had.	29.11956024169922
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	50.165714263916016
to all the
objections i have already urged, i have still another to add.	59.85757827758789
"and what did she say?"	33.12122344970703
"i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.	39.71837615966797
do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	38.16820526123047
"how can you talk so?"	44.40182876586914
"lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	43.046409606933594
certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."	43.46450424194336
"the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	79.29398345947266
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	36.61034393310547
"there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	36.05292892456055
i
always had a value for him.	32.58706283569336
my father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	33.00687026977539
i am quite well.	55.12669372558594
i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	40.09489822387695
--my mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right
     honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the church of england.	47.387908935546875
no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	28.810176849365234
they would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.	46.77341079711914
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	38.34964370727539
yours ever,

     "caroline bingley."	49.3504524230957
his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	17.675783157348633
something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	28.318315505981445
she could think only of her letter.	33.70112228393555
who attended to you?	42.14475631713867
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs
philips's manners and politeness.	80.53358459472656
i
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	49.747467041015625
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them.	33.56298065185547
1.e.3.	39.07307052612305
jane looked at her doubtingly.	33.6826286315918
at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	22.20413589477539
nor was darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	22.504941940307617
"her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament.	51.713443756103516
my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!	43.09122085571289
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	33.0030403137207
he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	59.245697021484375
and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless.	39.63026428222656
"yes, i have had a letter from him by express."	43.18267059326172
"to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham;
or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.	18.478376388549805
i roused, and
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_.	39.42045974731445
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	37.981727600097656
"yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it."	35.74313735961914
those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as mrs forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	21.771451950073242
when first mr bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	33.03464889526367
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	44.325904846191406
its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	41.842376708984375
and
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information.	27.834672927856445
"none at all.	39.63551712036133
the old lady is mrs jenkinson, who lives with them.	33.87936019897461
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.	42.65980911254883
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.	55.338680267333984
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	52.55048751831055
certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	15.982793807983398
"you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs nicholls was in
meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	18.9359130859375
i do not think it
is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.	25.19876480102539
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?	64.93628692626953
"we never had any governess."	74.62693786621094
she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	29.490089416503906
"oh, yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt.	48.5553092956543
"but you--how are you?"	58.59001541137695
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, i am sure.	54.307186126708984
but he is a
liberal master, i suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."	12.138080596923828
these parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	42.8563232421875
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	47.710052490234375
where shall you change
horses?--oh!	62.36383819580078
"some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	50.881752014160156
"well, then--supposing them to be in london.	41.56282043457031
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley!	27.509138107299805
"implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	27.3048152923584
"your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."	43.5777473449707
"why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned.	39.0982551574707
but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--here you are in your own family."	71.366455078125
"ah!	27.103544235229492
a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	31.789634704589844
they were to be off as soon as possible.	48.34642028808594
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	31.93780517578125
if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	40.88944625854492
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this
discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	44.28022003173828
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."	74.58686828613281
she tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	29.826135635375977
very little was said by either; kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	7.971529483795166
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	53.41162109375
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	52.67864227294922
thank heaven!	90.07148742675781
but
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	26.85923194885254
he has the
     promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the north.	51.74031448364258
he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	14.188196182250977
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy?"	25.073009490966797
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	41.658485412597656
stop me whilst you can."	37.36229705810547
"and can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"	29.82579231262207
there was no help
for it however.	62.01105499267578
can i speak plainer?	33.46414566040039
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for
elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	32.29926300048828
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?	88.31974792480469
the
adieu is charity itself.	34.4613037109375
indeed he has no improper pride.	63.05636978149414
how was that possible?	34.5524787902832
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	34.289794921875
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch-street by noon.	55.18718719482422
"it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."	43.14632034301758
i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.	68.7587661743164
he is perfectly amiable.	42.74505615234375
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	33.1325798034668
cried elizabeth when she had
finished it.	66.12686157226562
that he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!	35.50921630859375
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	19.64883041381836
"how strange this is!	56.985103607177734
within doors there
was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	30.468791961669922
i can hardly write for
     laughing.	41.7584228515625
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.	30.51980972290039
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	35.8192253112793
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--though lydia had
never been a favourite with them, mr and mrs gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	33.505733489990234
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr darcy--that mr darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week.	35.93910598754883
"you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by
all means to refuse him."	26.62845230102539
they solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	51.77128982543945
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	34.66640090942383
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	49.73881912231445
and so, darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission!	43.6971435546875
it was then disclosed in the following
manner.	27.542858123779297
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for
himself."	28.17859649658203
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."	47.067344665527344
there
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	62.78790283203125
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for mr collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.	43.614280700683594
the children have been wanting me this half hour.	48.75106430053711
"no, my dear; i think not.	27.969970703125
i was in the middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun."	35.57480239868164
"my dear, dear lydia!"	27.78182029724121
"it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	26.361862182617188
she was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."	51.39155578613281
mrs reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.	110.54523468017578
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	49.38530731201172
"but so we all do.	44.684417724609375
how is
such a man to be worked on?	52.98704528808594
the
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.	56.4301643371582
in future, i hope we shall be always of one
mind."	44.09036636352539
when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	36.019859313964844
i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.	20.777294158935547
i am so
grieved for him.	42.152034759521484
is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	34.757816314697266
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr
gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	35.906063079833984
wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to lydia's for him.	14.694219589233398
colonel fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	30.460695266723633
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family.	17.701845169067383
but papa is so
disagreeable."	39.526493072509766
it is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.	5.072373390197754
i
thank you for explaining it so fully.	58.57331085205078
all were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	29.29439926147461
"obstinate, headstrong girl!	56.72275924682617
elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of mr darcy.	41.175968170166016
"i am sick of mr bingley," cried his wife.	30.110387802124023
*       *       *       *       *




transcriber's note:

spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency
within the book.	45.27763366699219
but no
such recollection befriended her.	54.91724395751953
those were your words.	39.007652282714844
"miss bennet, do you know who i am?	63.73221969604492
there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	54.42682647705078
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	59.340301513671875
he placed himself by her.	46.09296417236328
if, indeed, it should be so!	102.44972229003906
i shall like it of all
things.	30.6000919342041
i
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his
     society in town.	38.11098098754883
and to see dear wickham too!	24.39923095703125
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	56.232601165771484
"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."	90.07256317138672
in three volumes.	44.37461853027344
to know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	82.86908721923828
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	34.354225158691406
we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	47.01491928100586
a house in town!	22.63374900817871
professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.	34.61277770996094
the garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.	17.06720733642578
i am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     hunsford.	45.76678466796875
it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to mr darcy.	43.92058181762695
good or bad?"	24.747236251831055
and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north.	35.26349639892578
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	47.46395492553711
"probably not;--but mr darcy can please where he chuses.	20.292211532592773
he
cannot afford it.	54.63020706176758
and then when we came away it was such fun!	22.91010284423828
i guessed as much."	37.71031188964844
nobody can tell what i
suffer!--but it is always so.	41.08918762207031
"_that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."	66.7467041015625
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	41.28424072265625
the horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	27.066015243530273
she cried.	49.01118850708008
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.	38.6292610168457
absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr collins.	38.63910675048828
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	56.130558013916016
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried elizabeth.	50.30421447753906
as all
conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.	41.121891021728516
she was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.	38.26355743408203
all was joy and
kindness.	27.90772819519043
he made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.	34.920719146728516
a scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	34.293880462646484
"i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	15.09227180480957
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	37.51177978515625
so, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."	28.61145782470703
you supposed more than
     really existed.	46.35433578491211
poor kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder.	45.11738967895508
upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."	38.53902816772461
by this time she is
actually with them!	46.248416900634766
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	43.18159103393555
miss bingley said something of his never
     returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.	55.28914260864258
"wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	89.34983825683594
you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	44.61425018310547
i was afraid they might
not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was
determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like
any thing."	25.833059310913086
"indeed i could not.	36.75690460205078
the idea of mr collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	24.849489212036133
"i never heard that it was."	36.79395294189453
"this account then is what he has received from mr darcy.	45.958011627197266
it is a nice long walk, and mr darcy has
never seen the view."	30.941930770874023
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	40.93013381958008
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
detained first by the civility of mr collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	33.73499298095703
it
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	37.35907745361328
why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	11.632343292236328
"is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"	55.35395431518555
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	37.66075134277344
he bore it however with admirable calmness.	33.974918365478516
and there was my
aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	51.88900375366211
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"you look conscious.	46.93701171875
"exceedingly well.	45.50881576538086
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?	38.540306091308594
i told my sister philips so the other day.	68.8277816772461
your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
you.	67.13064575195312
it convinced her, that
accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town.	34.56535720825195
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	51.398231506347656
if i may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."	33.61219787597656
"this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced."	32.319793701171875
was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	50.470924377441406
on finding
mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"	31.77068328857422
"i see your design, bingley," said his friend.--"you dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."	38.27404022216797
"then, who taught you?	56.26993942260742
though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	33.91111755371094
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!	54.06552505493164
when they
had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said,

"this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	43.20869827270508
he had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.	67.86359405517578
i
     take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not,
     but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible.	28.60079002380371
"_you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne
for fifty pounds!	67.04596710205078
"their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
i, nor any body, can ever forget.	20.281736373901367
secondly, that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness.	42.15958023071289
well, but now for
my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	21.15675163269043
and a
special licence.	17.594457626342773
calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.	98.54206848144531
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied darcy.	75.31660461425781
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	11.26115894317627
what is it about?	92.30693817138672
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	59.23479080200195
how can it affect them?"	37.37067413330078
"this is not to be borne.	40.06132125854492
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	40.11170959472656
mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than
mrs bennet and mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces.	44.29689025878906
i rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.	41.45448303222656
you have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.	22.206016540527344
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	38.845943450927734
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	73.7633056640625
elizabeth immediately began playing again.	26.10631561279297
you know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	73.11724090576172
"i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield.	36.1771354675293
it may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	39.238521575927734
"oh!	73.11724090576172
she looked at jane, to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
talking to bingley.	39.29051971435547
it is of all subjects my delight.	33.38499069213867
"oh!	34.08485412597656
"he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."	13.070600509643555
we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	23.13448715209961
"my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me.	35.53105545043945
those who do not complain are never
pitied."	32.16050338745117
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	35.3542366027832
with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed.	35.86075973510742
"we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire."	29.574296951293945
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	27.643096923828125
there was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	49.49460220336914
indeed, eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."	60.203765869140625
seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	40.84248352050781
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.	58.834922790527344
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	32.67140579223633
"that is as it happens.	26.03076934814453
"your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	45.70069122314453
you have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."	33.64562225341797
their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	55.82564926147461
"and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	31.836318969726562
mr darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to mrs collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	29.881669998168945
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	64.0145263671875
the
possibility of meeting mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	32.26893997192383
"lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	35.086421966552734
how is half such a sum to be
repaid?"	25.70102882385254
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling."	39.51979446411133
at present i will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	8.377090454101562
miss lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	33.98575973510742
his words
seemed to imply it.	38.33205795288086
make haste, make haste.	33.257667541503906
mrs bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	62.401493072509766
had the late mr darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life.	32.15286636352539
"but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	17.47264289855957
"i should imagine not."	31.285741806030273
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	53.650447845458984
but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them.	27.354324340820312
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	23.536577224731445
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	51.3182487487793
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	33.32423400878906
now is your time.	32.88825225830078
"he must be an oddity, i think," said she.	31.332942962646484
two days after mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask."	77.17241668701172
i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."	24.426332473754883
i shall send for my
     clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up.	40.83377456665039
march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford.	53.18394088745117
accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.	77.48403930664062
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	38.71845245361328
my dear mr bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?	57.95684051513672
but who was your mother?	80.68495178222656
mr collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and mr darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	34.71575164794922
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	36.045562744140625
how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	35.21381759643555
if you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	38.75306701660156
"we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--how much i shall have to tell!"	23.476083755493164
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs
gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	46.137699127197266
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	38.763118743896484
"all young ladies accomplished!	41.090274810791016
"i should never have said mrs collins
was settled _near_ her family."	41.57050704956055
mr
bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before."	39.95801544189453
mr darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"this walk is not wide enough for our party.	2.7370657920837402
jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw mr darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	43.46846008300781
it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's
attractions.	52.696876525878906
oh!	29.643756866455078
let us hope for
better things.	50.576011657714844
"you begin to comprehend me, do you?"	23.78472900390625
they were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	51.92383575439453
after
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.	44.96262741088867
"i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."	43.60441589355469
"my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	55.423946380615234
since her
father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."	13.939236640930176
if there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	38.3443603515625
so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	53.889739990234375
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	39.26203536987305
they walked on, without knowing in what direction.	43.537078857421875
he was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	26.981822967529297
i hope they will not meet at all.	38.326236724853516
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy."	60.02330017089844
she stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	70.65505981445312
"but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	37.794342041015625
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	22.629627227783203
"i know them a little.	24.763755798339844
it was first broken by mrs annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and mrs gardiner, with occasional help from
elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	37.35905075073242
promise me, therefore, to
come to hunsford."	41.8305549621582
"oh!"	52.98253631591797
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	21.14842414855957
and with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."	38.45784378051758
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	28.62702751159668
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	37.3821907043457
"well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
collinses live very comfortable, do they?	35.76303482055664
she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."	29.808746337890625
"but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.	27.477312088012695
their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	37.76750183105469
charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility.	73.11724090576172
but i make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	41.612060546875
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you."	44.21392822265625
"oh!	29.185054779052734
"your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.	28.989381790161133
i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	32.996070861816406
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	18.917299270629883
it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."	29.97956085205078
but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
dare say, very agreeable.	44.66658020019531
it is useless to talk of it."	25.668689727783203
he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to elizabeth again, he walked away.	24.347728729248047
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	39.68156814575195
but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."	32.380897521972656
not that i am afraid
of _myself_, but i dread other people's remarks."	26.317224502563477
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with wickham!--imagine our surprise.	40.11851119995117
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"is not this nice?	41.585636138916016
"no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	28.958906173706055
"from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry."	28.799739837646484
if he fears me, why come hither?	20.953706741333008
mr jones says we must not think of moving her.	34.64154052734375
the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine's drawing-room.	37.48640060424805
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	27.455137252807617
he danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	40.51747512817383
"and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."	44.96451950073242
it will not do.	27.663652420043945
i enquired after their brother, of course.	31.04872703552246
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	36.08987045288086
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"	45.70352554321289
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, mr darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	45.963722229003906
"her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	42.70235824584961
but
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted.	36.534423828125
to the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	25.036890029907227
through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	31.467132568359375
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.	55.9039421081543
if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	32.50657653808594
miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	27.590492248535156
mr collins was eloquent in her praise.	36.768821716308594
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	30.97000503540039
don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
     that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side.	31.366180419921875
i knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.	2.7370657920837402
elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	31.956573486328125
as they drove to mr gardiner's
door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	34.2166633605957
oh!	21.845373153686523
cried mrs gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	34.33855438232422
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	22.88414764404297
you are safe from me."	39.540122985839844
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	56.34702682495117
unfeeling, selfish girl!	37.26416778564453
"both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	36.41047668457031
"i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."	43.72325134277344
he only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."	52.03750991821289
she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."	48.540645599365234
she
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	23.91952896118164
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known sir william's too long.	48.63207244873047
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	19.18381118774414
mr and mrs gardiner smiled.	28.863880157470703
"the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	52.52245330810547
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	43.04098892211914
let me never see either
one or the other again!"	38.95536804199219
it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	23.221553802490234
if i could but see _you_ as happy!	15.184318542480469
her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	11.991914749145508
charlotte is an
excellent manager, i dare say.	30.187509536743164
let me mend it for you.	31.03403091430664
he
drew a chair near her.	28.951156616210938
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	51.488319396972656
she had heard nothing of
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	41.042911529541016
he heard her attentively, and then said,

"lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."	44.1483039855957
you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing."	36.74021911621094
on this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	46.196563720703125
i could hardly keep my countenance.	30.054927825927734
her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh."	2.7370657920837402
his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	32.356388092041016
if your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning.	34.72570037841797
oh!	43.81070327758789
exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good.	38.892723083496094
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	40.11848831176758
he spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.	34.21260070800781
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to
wickham.	35.69404220581055
jane was by no means better.	44.42436981201172
no officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.	30.839771270751953
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	29.994401931762695
i do think mrs long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."	38.83070373535156
"indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	31.890226364135742
_they_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	42.52383804321289
we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way.	31.102304458618164
i should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire."	40.38124465942383
"if he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "i shall give him up for
ever."	30.483083724975586
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	29.469661712646484
her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire.	40.79795455932617
her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	52.132389068603516
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.	35.055145263671875
for
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	41.591041564941406
he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	23.949071884155273
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,

"lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe.	37.02873992919922
you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	19.087379455566406
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	42.96776580810547
from the entrance hall, of which mr collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine,
her daughter, and mrs jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	23.51089096069336
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	47.4836540222168
"thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	21.07735824584961
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	38.74610900878906
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.	35.90611267089844
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.	33.298805236816406
when mrs bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	49.53514862060547
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	15.367603302001953
at least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."	69.00506591796875
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	36.80313491821289
pray do not talk of that odious man.	38.58987045288086
but with _me_, it is not so.	34.077491760253906
he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.	33.49240493774414
he looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at pemberley.	48.4775390625
the former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	63.90945816040039
my temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."	56.15141296386719
but i will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	27.507272720336914
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield.	38.905113220214844
"his manners are very different from his cousin's."	28.89022445678711
upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	14.329750061035156
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	48.46391677856445
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	33.113311767578125
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	39.77153015136719
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for.	45.25541305541992
she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	58.51409912109375
"my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope to make you love me.	38.041080474853516
it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	31.82443618774414
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	15.830719947814941
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	59.64502716064453
he had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."	32.69437026977539
cried elizabeth.	32.5364990234375
on saturday he came again.	28.30997085571289
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate.	34.36840057373047
"miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that i am not to be trifled with.	42.47261047363281
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	13.261942863464355
but amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following,
     as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly
     went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference.	31.658769607543945
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	36.49092483520508
she was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	34.06416320800781
mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	33.470638275146484
she read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	32.95673370361328
in
talking over their route the evening before, mrs gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.	33.0601921081543
he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him."	69.50103759765625
her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	31.04296112060547
in
truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings."	15.99773120880127
and for _this_ we are to be
thankful.	54.2740592956543
every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	38.53612518310547
you need not.	21.549118041992188
"it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	33.403865814208984
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	21.992109298706055
said he; "that is rather singular."	22.451871871948242
she was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	28.287031173706055
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do, when i
tell you all."	48.69023513793945
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	22.097679138183594
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	33.62510299682617
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	21.1087589263916
"indeed!"	45.82622528076172
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	28.511695861816406
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	38.45060729980469
it was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	19.148672103881836
but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	42.43513870239258
then turning to mr bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	16.96689796447754
i thought i should have broke my heart."	29.769668579101562
when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	41.282413482666016
it is too long ago.	32.69937515258789
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	94.14198303222656
"my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."	28.235700607299805
"yes, or i will never see her again."	26.632827758789062
her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	55.79531478881836
"i must ask whether you were surprised?"	35.497642517089844
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and
mrs collins well."	32.148136138916016
but make a virtue of it
by all means.	57.33365249633789
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know, and read great
books, and make extracts."	38.699764251708984
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	23.356008529663086
why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	38.009586334228516
- you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing or by e-mail within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg-tm
     license.	38.72360610961914
it is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.	39.69506072998047
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	47.26190185546875
she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	33.867923736572266
elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	170.6087188720703
nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	26.934728622436523
what are men
to rocks and mountains?	30.693429946899414
"very, very much.	38.163856506347656
i am only ashamed of his asking so little."	31.934688568115234
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	35.98332214355469
jane was not happy.	42.105628967285156
let me advise you then, my dear sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.	35.213714599609375
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make _me_
happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."	33.76116943359375
"i am not now to learn," replied mr collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	34.6540641784668
he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."	34.591827392578125
"my dear jane!"	27.0939884185791
their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	23.771121978759766
not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	44.1987419128418
yet now i must believe you," cried
jane.	44.92250061035156
nothing could be more delightful!	29.580299377441406
"upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--pray, what is your age?"	40.03704833984375
"oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	41.18949508666992
"and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business."	49.687843322753906
having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	52.90814208984375
on this
subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left
hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'mr collins, you
must marry.	39.22909164428711
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of
short duration.	31.15998077392578
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs forster,
the delight of mrs bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
to be described.	47.22343444824219
it is from my cousin, mr collins, who, when i am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	35.43410873413086
"_you_ were mr bingley's first choice."	22.295177459716797
did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in kent?"	79.26959991455078
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin.	32.237586975097656
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	52.24293518066406
poor little lizzy!	42.797481536865234
the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
lydia's infamy somewhat better.	25.999588012695312
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	31.729276657104492
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when
he put his letter into her hand!	29.459253311157227
in a few minutes, mrs bennet half opened the door and called out,

"lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you."	51.708831787109375
not all that mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley.	35.48359298706055
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	28.86130714416504
"i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	40.345272064208984
you may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night.	20.03132438659668
"i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am
gone."	45.61638259887695
this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	33.7532958984375
but my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards miss king.	28.981609344482422
"you are joking, lizzy.	22.650224685668945
i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the
country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	34.15855026245117
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent.	43.002254486083984
it adds even another motive.	37.287593841552734
pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	35.79854202270508
"i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always speak
what i think."	92.27154541015625
"i told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	24.596145629882812
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	78.78458404541016
"what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	25.31285858154297
with his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	31.227224349975586
"very true; and if i had my will, we should.	29.025205612182617
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	40.58029556274414
it seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	37.44152069091797
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies.	66.22297668457031
i know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have
     still something more to ask of the former.	17.255645751953125
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	25.213560104370117
i am glad
he is gone.	39.45637893676758
mr bingley followed his advice.	24.482885360717773
but i
will not repine.	48.75217056274414
she longed to see mrs philips, the lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to mrs hill and the two housemaids.	84.46936798095703
mr bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	78.4625015258789
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	21.32000732421875
so much the man of fashion!	29.45781707763672
my dear charlotte,--impossible!"	52.86963653564453
"good gracious!"	60.29949951171875
elizabeth made no answer.	26.84917449951172
such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!	59.41881561279297
interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	50.55076599121094
not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive.	35.98598861694336
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months!	28.60549545288086
"what think you of books?"	24.538461685180664
"but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."	19.973358154296875
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.	26.988737106323242
"very well.--that reply will do for the present.--perhaps by and bye i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--but _now_ we may be silent."	37.89250946044922
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	153.2611083984375
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	49.87575149536133
"well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	15.594694137573242
mr what's his name.	40.649044036865234
she knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.	28.926923751831055
i know we dine with four and twenty families."	29.95055389404297
she saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	22.13577651977539
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	16.893726348876953
no
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	24.393117904663086
colonel forster will, i dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	81.0324935913086
this matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."	40.520423889160156
mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.	31.98911476135254
"good heaven!	42.25339889526367
after sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth,

"i hope you are well, miss bennet.	51.583003997802734
her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	53.29840087890625
they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	73.3077163696289
when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	50.38180160522461
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.	45.236236572265625
it was to be such a secret!"	29.290159225463867
bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	32.43282699584961
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.	47.12722396850586
i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	27.40062713623047
while sir william was with them, mr collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	30.817426681518555
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	35.065696716308594
"his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.	24.966461181640625
i pity, though i
     cannot help blaming her.	31.341550827026367
that he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	36.34343338012695
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	38.75559616088867
i speak
feelingly.	18.706539154052734
"he
only told me, what i have now told you."	32.32209396362305
if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.	41.28023910522461
you shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	48.8499870300293
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about.	20.64241600036621
i will read it to you--

"when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	38.03361129760742
the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	41.2937126159668
"that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."	40.23727035522461
is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very
ill."

"no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	27.612628936767578
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	26.504554748535156
she had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr wickham
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows."	19.80998420715332
you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mother's permission for this address.	53.444786071777344
she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	41.3175163269043
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	28.21510124206543
"or in other words, you are determined to have him.	32.12494659423828
their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.	35.03750991821289
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and i know i appeared distressed.	38.03712844848633
you know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	34.25408935546875
yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."	48.392799377441406
jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	36.65216827392578
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	29.495052337646484
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?	33.54642105102539
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr philips's.	30.49349594116211
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment.	26.97671890258789
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.	31.65452766418457
to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained.	43.12015151977539
but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.	28.22234535217285
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham.	40.897552490234375
what are we to do!"	57.921226501464844
"what does mr darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?"	50.376338958740234
why any fear of detection?	50.95986557006836
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	12.3270902633667
you _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	17.28740692138672
he was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	25.571420669555664
"do you prefer reading to cards?"	29.430538177490234
then shewing
her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet.	20.69866371154785
as they passed through the hall,
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	29.407419204711914
"you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	28.22974395751953
you are lucky in
having such a master."	56.85718536376953
change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."	35.119529724121094
reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	19.682598114013672
_invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square._

_engraved for no.	43.14101791381836
mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	41.323997497558594
"we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	30.537582397460938
"there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	29.649120330810547
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely."	26.699607849121094
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,"
said mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, i shall have nothing to wish for."	39.619686126708984
mr gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was saturday.	40.560699462890625
mr wickham
had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	44.09895324707031
the sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	43.317806243896484
cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after mr and mrs gardiner.	43.313438415527344
not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	44.35127258300781
"an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	28.479045867919922
"you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."	31.851314544677734
to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	41.90198516845703
"i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."	31.249080657958984
however, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."	29.401384353637695
bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.	38.4318733215332
"your examination of mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss
bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	39.86363220214844
it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	46.64588928222656
he cannot know what mr
darcy is."	37.52333068847656
two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	73.11724090576172
he has given in all his debts; i hope
     at least he has not deceived us.	53.80525588989258
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	19.724275588989258
"oh!	26.605411529541016
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	46.6020622253418
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.	63.314735412597656
"take whatever you like, and get away."	35.52593994140625
"you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr darcy?"	42.5520133972168
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	23.852304458618164
i did not think mrs
gardiner was so little to be trusted."	27.5918025970459
"i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	38.462013244628906
she dared not
even mention that gentleman.	80.53358459472656
"we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	26.7667179107666
the vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr darcy could not have.	45.949214935302734
1.c.	86.59678649902344
mrs collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	26.793642044067383
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	20.059179306030273
i have not _that_ pain.	55.32569885253906
it is almost past belief.	42.959537506103516
you are so strange!	55.11541748046875
it was
the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	19.931297302246094
when this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	6.97306489944458
perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice.	36.87651824951172
it has been my own doing,
and i ought to feel it."	18.171655654907227
"nearly three weeks."	20.305736541748047
i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his
regimentals."	37.46995544433594
did you see him while you were at lambton?	17.388105392456055
i
did not expect such a compliment."	40.73147964477539
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	46.706573486328125
to kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected.	30.439037322998047
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	15.347146034240723
well, i was so frightened i did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	2.7370657920837402
they had long wished to see him.	36.27778625488281
but it is so
strange!"	28.773651123046875
oh!	36.0453987121582
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	42.096717834472656
"i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	22.044342041015625
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr darcy.--_i_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."	32.71384048461914
heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	55.573341369628906
sir william did not say much.	42.53807830810547
he begged
pardon for having displeased her.	64.55106353759766
at that moment, she cared for no other.	23.070945739746094
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	19.501649856567383
i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.	27.54750633239746
i have suspected it some time, but
i am now convinced."	23.499385833740234
"i can easily believe it.	27.171499252319336
in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	46.194271087646484
she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	31.915258407592773
the effect was immediate.	31.109012603759766
"in what an amiable light does this place him!"	28.063417434692383
in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he
wants you in the library."	18.2923641204834
"well, lizzy," said mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of jane's?	38.10871887207031
my sole dependence was on you; and
i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	44.38393783569336
she wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	41.216529846191406
elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	43.6789665222168
not a soul knew of it, but col. and mrs
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	38.0569953918457
"what do you mean, mr bennet, by talking in this way?	27.329559326171875
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
case?"	44.678199768066406
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.	55.7889289855957
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	33.34382629394531
"true," said mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."	24.423263549804688
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on.	31.98725700378418
it is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	16.676816940307617
georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	44.075660705566406
it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.	22.419469833374023
"and mary king is safe!"	23.834548950195312
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done.	20.497106552124023
a few weeks, he believed.	22.287443161010742
the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	46.458160400390625
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."	28.555076599121094
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.	55.60374069213867
at length darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."	46.65049362182617
no."	21.985273361206055
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."	39.905616760253906
she followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!	56.70237350463867
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.	41.44224166870117
i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	30.344993591308594
your's, &c."

mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what mr bennet sent to mr collins, in
reply to his last.	25.647754669189453
as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	33.68730545043945
they were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	31.12906265258789
we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."	121.30139923095703
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; mr bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
fixed for the following tuesday.	36.84109115600586
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy.	32.25321578979492
it is unaccountable!	29.721750259399414
she shall hear my opinion."	34.07892990112305
kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	38.09593963623047
she wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false!	62.077735900878906
charlotte did not stay much
longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	38.89546585083008
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to mr bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	28.495664596557617
but that is nothing to us.	32.34103012084961
"what do you think?	24.329879760742188
such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	2.7370657920837402
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was
shocked.	31.723134994506836
you
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be.	48.02122116088867
oh!	37.44666290283203
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
about this report?	36.73020935058594
she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.	21.540477752685547
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.	30.38161277770996
"there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.	9.047398567199707
i do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy."	35.40359115600586
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's
visit.	61.15262222290039
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered.	26.74344253540039
her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	53.34857940673828
the carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	45.86721420288086
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town
next saturday."	14.625240325927734
his father, miss bennet, the late mr darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	27.035120010375977
the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, mr bingley?"	12.516191482543945
never mind miss
lizzy's hair."	52.26762771606445
it had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	36.285797119140625
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	30.847633361816406
"i am not one and twenty."	41.27802658081055
very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	54.47805404663086
"i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	29.582965850830078
on the very day of my coming
     home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	27.657501220703125
"i am afraid, mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."	31.61234474182129
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity.	26.452653884887695
catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to london.	51.43922805786133
my sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel
     fitzwilliam, and myself.	35.85801696777344
they
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	21.72103500366211
"i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel
millar's regiment went away.	121.41707611083984
"why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"	41.996177673339844
oh, no."	41.41611099243164
there's for you!	51.95123291015625
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	36.52898025512695
but now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage.	73.11724090576172
the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	25.787675857543945
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn.	30.16786766052246
"oh!	34.56051254272461
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	37.595611572265625
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	40.78084945678711
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.	27.997753143310547
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	25.727813720703125
not that _i_ think
charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."	32.735328674316406
she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	29.478687286376953
he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley's salutation.	37.723236083984375
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	44.85060501098633
the advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	30.104145050048828
and her neighbours at
lucas lodge, therefore, for through their communication with the
collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	32.50143814086914
it would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	33.46519470214844
"when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	49.42049026489258
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	44.64563751220703
my feelings in every respect
forbid it.	42.5560417175293
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	26.204832077026367
"yes, and i had heard it before.	27.582904815673828
would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	22.10015106201172
yes, yes.	29.88150978088379
jane now came up.	42.30418014526367
not these two or three years perhaps."	22.08481788635254
bingley met them with hopes
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.	31.29704475402832
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	56.71965408325195
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia,
assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn.	35.14444351196289
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	20.19768524169922
"if i were as rich as mr darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his
sisters, "i should not care how proud i was.	27.035192489624023
_he_ was
     exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
     would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter
     last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain.	33.14558029174805
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	33.70903015136719
much as i abominate
writing, i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any
consideration.	32.09813690185547
"_i_ never saw such a woman.	68.8458023071289
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	46.12442398071289
you must send john with
the young ladies, mrs collins.	31.849355697631836
they are
wanted in the farm, mr bennet, are not they?"	28.454029083251953
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	20.944549560546875
"and what is fifty miles of good road?	34.30625534057617
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?"	34.426246643066406
but i dare not
hope it.	40.730342864990234
"in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	16.589622497558594
when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	42.2454719543457
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	24.671367645263672
"your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	35.61344909667969
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.	35.50950622558594
her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	26.608951568603516
be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	21.777921676635742
mr
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	44.88762283325195
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to.	42.65407180786133
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	23.564180374145508
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i
     laugh.	34.51266860961914
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.	31.526142120361328
--

"my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	29.628747940063477
elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	52.166961669921875
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, mr darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."	46.48500442504883
darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.	25.459463119506836
two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	45.992034912109375
family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	27.06003761291504
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	32.40116882324219
mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	17.90497398376465
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	48.06605911254883
"can it be
possible that he will marry her?"	24.39863395690918
that lady i suppose is your mother."	29.528522491455078
but, lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	29.824634552001953
said elizabeth.	37.573665618896484
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.	33.518917083740234
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	58.05813217163086
"two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	27.67538833618164
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's."	8.353558540344238
ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	36.28700637817383
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."	25.355621337890625
"because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	399.08245849609375
"whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes.	41.44910430908203
had he done his duty in that
respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	31.468873977661133
'ah!	31.170011520385742
while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	32.80317306518555
my youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who i believe will soon become a part of the family."	28.30390167236328
"much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."	79.52739715576172
she was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.	35.19303512573242
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"	36.268638610839844
mamma would like to
go too of all things!	29.765989303588867
"oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
scotland."	29.081289291381836
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--mr collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	37.15892028808594
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	41.99334716796875
"which do you mean?"	29.328327178955078
it
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	25.288490295410156
"he is as fine a fellow," said mr bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever i saw.	19.575361251831055
that is the place to get
husbands.	40.01051330566406
mrs
reynolds could interest her on no other point.	18.454483032226562
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	22.973709106445312
it originated in
mrs gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	18.98679542541504
she directly replied,

"you need not be frightened.	37.63154602050781
"you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with cold civility,
"that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."	36.991024017333984
"let me be rightly understood.	35.01652145385742
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	26.468976974487305
with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	57.19927215576172
you know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	33.381561279296875
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance."	66.7467041015625
"yes, all of them, i think.	17.997726440429688
while
there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	49.027652740478516
she cried.	31.3024845123291
but don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.	34.080631256103516
haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week.	32.66631317138672
to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	39.364933013916016
by tea-time however the dose had been enough, and mr bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	30.258333206176758
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	34.703651428222656
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	39.86733627319336
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	62.68272399902344
they
are my old friends.	43.13863754272461
"it may do very well for the others," replied mr bingley; "but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty.	29.845043182373047
my avowed one, or what i avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made."	33.5629768371582
have you never
happened to see her there?"	32.983768463134766
his character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr
darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	35.19610595703125
mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.	34.889793395996094
a promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	38.1495475769043
she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	72.74274444580078
miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy.	24.07549476623535
i have a high respect for your nerves.	27.944868087768555
"with the officers!"	37.5151252746582
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving
home.	52.693424224853516
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	35.865447998046875
"he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	38.551353454589844
"i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage.	38.22541427612305
the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.	35.9041633605957
"i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him.	40.03125762939453
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	28.48639678955078
but pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	40.798667907714844
were it known to the rest
of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	16.128570556640625
but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.	39.59482192993164
her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	30.92962646484375
there is nothing else to be done.	21.88852882385254
in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	40.008365631103516
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh
looked that way.	46.35813903808594
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.	32.05424880981445
she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"is your sister at pemberley still?"	33.9417610168457
i am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	23.37872886657715
and his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	42.57334518432617
she respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	29.728126525878906
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	19.9054012298584
"when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and
when i am in town it is pretty much the same.	24.888948440551758
"i am all astonishment.	32.19293975830078
i longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	40.30960464477539
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	28.321468353271484
if i wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	15.67493724822998
i do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	43.02126693725586
"let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."	28.774673461914062
unless the elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	32.94007110595703
and then we were so merry all the way home!	49.119712829589844
*       *       *       *       *

in the evening, soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	36.86128234863281
with a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at netherfield.	46.39887237548828
he still loves me, and we are
engaged."	27.51814842224121
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	29.015975952148438
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	26.30878448486328
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	29.462173461914062
it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	28.491413116455078
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at
present i have not room to do them justice."	25.589948654174805
he did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	22.22332000732422
"it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	33.98056411743164
charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley."	28.725177764892578
she had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	52.16344451904297
he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."	18.615856170654297
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	51.26170349121094
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	36.2647819519043
"you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan."	38.24049377441406
but i was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	30.098461151123047
said she.	43.87197494506836
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.	32.443111419677734
bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	32.24958038330078
jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.	38.085811614990234
after sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london,
mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	31.27092170715332
"he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	37.422943115234375
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	33.92880630493164
there are few people
whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.	50.916812896728516
painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	23.319351196289062
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	55.4825439453125
and so
she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	38.95009231567383
i told mrs collins so before you came.	45.910362243652344
"nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth.	12.893128395080566
i have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	47.90959548950195
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day.	40.054664611816406
"i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	46.63839340209961
but on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	19.007429122924805
"my dear brother,

     "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction.	92.01456451416016
"you know nothing of the matter.	40.2996940612793
you must contrive to send
somebody.	18.932186126708984
"are you, indeed?	43.8035888671875
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	41.296546936035156
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	35.793888092041016
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world!	60.047000885009766
they were hopeless of remedy.	52.629817962646484
"when you have killed all your own birds, mr bingley," said her mother,
"i beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on mr
bennet's manor.	25.331417083740234
mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	36.44224548339844
i perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	16.875022888183594
"i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	43.957191467285156
but i will no longer importune my young cousin."	19.929466247558594
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	20.101598739624023
"will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"	31.75008201599121
mr darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	33.64725875854492
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.	53.643287658691406
but however he did not.	35.68996810913086
i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	36.53525924682617
to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	33.64070510864258
yet he knew to the contrary himself.	24.995447158813477
she could
think of nothing but of mr wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent.	37.881561279296875
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	37.79097366333008
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.	72.15666198730469
he must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.	23.739774703979492
with a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	39.40130615234375
and pray what sort of guardians do you make?	48.50474166870117
"i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	29.563228607177734
"i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	37.92512130737305
i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	32.53687286376953
though lydia's short
     letter to mrs f. gave them to understand that they were going to
     gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief
     that w. never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which
     was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from b. intending to trace their route.	18.70383071899414
regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and mrs younge was of course removed from
     her charge.	37.30472183227539
this room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	19.749183654785156
we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	23.173189163208008
his choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing.	34.760501861572266
her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	42.95510482788086
sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know
that mr collins wants to marry lizzy?"	39.31498336791992
wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.	35.789852142333984
is this to be endured!	30.38603973388672
lizzy, to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family!	29.597150802612305
"there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow
me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton?"	25.22897720336914
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	59.30086898803711
"i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.	30.319955825805664
i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	267.10943603515625
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	22.231233596801758
she dared not relate the other
half of mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	29.66133689880371
she repeated.	31.208904266357422
she was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	29.742229461669922
i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	41.050235748291016
"that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs bennet, "and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	29.4648494720459
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
bingley.	40.50105667114258
but she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.	31.265653610229492
such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	49.43049240112305
"but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."	39.72494125366211
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."	20.794036865234375
the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.	55.87177658081055
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	58.27024459838867
"i never heard any thing so
abominable.	28.377277374267578
the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	76.49456787109375
"but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for.	27.62788200378418
are quite well."	25.251399993896484
the
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	13.252824783325195
bingley was by no means deficient,
but darcy was clever.	25.97823715209961
i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn."	15.900336265563965
its completion depended on others.	22.052194595336914
and she was only sixteen last june.	23.938081741333008
- you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of project gutenberg-tm works.	16.32918930053711
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	28.427135467529297
"i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if _i_
should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia."	27.64497947692871
how thankful am i,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves.	23.032005310058594
and as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	50.438514709472656
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	29.459491729736328
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	33.57032012939453
she is grown so brown and coarse!	22.497501373291016
*       *       *       *       *

it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.	18.902713775634766
in society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	28.11576271057129
but mrs bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	48.88462448120117
he begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any
message to her.	26.485275268554688
what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	18.753820419311523
has she any family?"	33.41572952270508
"i am astonished, my dear," said mrs bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	9.493741035461426
lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.	39.43199157714844
it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	57.26051330566406
her report was highly favourable.	37.29031753540039
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil?	35.227561950683594
"i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	34.92256546020508
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	37.02241897583008
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.	25.3614444732666
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except mary agreed to go with her; and mr collins was to attend them,
at the request of mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither mr collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.	22.387428283691406
he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.	16.331350326538086
the
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."	32.178367614746094
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr darcy, who sat opposite to them.	40.652408599853516
he
comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday.	36.640419006347656
"and do you like her?"	29.20884132385254
it amazes
me, i confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.	36.2463264465332
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	73.11724090576172
she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	14.561422348022461
this was invitation enough.	101.99022674560547
"oh!	36.30641174316406
"yet why did he come?"	23.01434326171875
when is your turn to come?	29.540124893188477
mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!	55.710750579833984
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.	51.05590057373047
they met again on sunday, and
     then _i_ saw him too.	39.09535598754883
"tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	34.09539031982422
but the case is
this.	44.95893096923828
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.	19.16349983215332
on being made acquainted with the
present mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	19.78988265991211
in anticipating the happiness of bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	33.85976028442383
it will save me a world of trouble
and economy.	30.005531311035156
mr darcy walked off; and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	27.90801429748535
but however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	39.085723876953125
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley's."	30.580293655395508
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.	23.501440048217773
as for
their mother, mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.	85.95382690429688
"pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried mr collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	45.87769317626953
in spite of having been at st. james's, sir william was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	39.73369216918945
"in essentials, i believe, he is very much
what he ever was."	47.566261291503906
how rich
and how great you will be!	28.00223731994629
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	24.763755798339844
to be sure london was
rather thin, but however the little theatre was open.	35.36418533325195
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster's.	36.04682922363281
"oh!"	19.628841400146484
it is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like."	22.444961547851562
they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	32.61061096191406
miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	40.95709991455078
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	30.698942184448242
on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	28.075685501098633
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	22.052194595336914
it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	4.413529872894287
but i suppose you had no opportunity.	24.41481590270996
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	25.440967559814453
good bye.	24.72368049621582
she smiled, but made no answer.	17.933013916015625
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project
gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.	48.190406799316406
besides, there was truth in his
looks."	39.56480407714844
"that is not very likely; our authority was too good."	29.135971069335938
yes;--there is nothing in that.	20.068639755249023
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	36.44559860229492
four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.	25.98568344116211
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	37.951053619384766
and is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	30.134519577026367
jane was distressed.	52.8358039855957
darcy, after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	33.13218688964844
miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	26.326738357543945
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	42.5697021484375
"she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	33.01078414916992
_you_ cannot have
been always at longbourn."	12.04649829864502
by all that i have
ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	40.63679504394531
elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.	30.283414840698242
every body is disgusted with his pride.	23.50391960144043
it is mr bingley
i am sure.	132.3800506591797
1813.	40.7405891418457
my friend has an excellent understanding--though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	36.72898483276367
surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.	39.120941162109375
she had very little notice from any but him.	12.344698905944824
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	38.103858947753906
but perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	20.006118774414062
said he,
as he joined her.	59.09437942504883
mr bennet protested against any
description of finery.	32.569156646728516
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	40.69934844970703
we must not
all expect jane's good fortune."	13.87752628326416
"we
can all plague and punish one another.	48.4775390625
the comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	39.817359924316406
here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	26.8316593170166
if _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"	31.425649642944336
and _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	30.21881866455078
elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	69.7488021850586
not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
i know are all chance in this world.	55.530426025390625
the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	166.3620147705078
but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for mrs bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	24.49617576599121
"how good it was in you, my dear mr bennet!	33.413352966308594
she
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.	45.59624481201172
letters of business too!	32.9906005859375
well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	35.61851501464844
will you be very angry with me, my dear
     lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
     enough to say before how much i like him.	19.358795166015625
"and pray
may i ask?"	49.48190689086914
she will be down in a moment i dare say."	42.17677307128906
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	33.46412658691406
"and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."	48.087440490722656
i cannot think so very ill of
wickham.	34.033260345458984
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	16.096481323242188
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	37.62578582763672
"well, well, and so mr bingley is coming down, sister," for mrs
philips first brought her the news.	33.87153625488281
and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.	28.74828338623047
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	28.519031524658203
"i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions."	26.158863067626953
charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	30.515024185180664
it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say
nothing of that.	47.05105972290039
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	30.354610443115234
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	28.016557693481445
"i will make no promise of the kind."	23.553298950195312
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton.	29.654443740844727
the next was in these words.	35.963043212890625
the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	46.21900939941406
when they repaired to the
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	65.30583953857422
repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."	33.73955154418945
"i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	37.98091506958008
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!	39.55803680419922
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire.	15.267970085144043
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg:

1.e.1.	14.70019817352295
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.	17.91139030456543
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.	39.50922393798828
"do you certainly leave kent on saturday?"	37.7454948425293
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	49.79027557373047
mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	26.923730850219727
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	31.666364669799805
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	54.99268341064453
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."	64.03462219238281
the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her.	29.920263290405273
"oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	9.697358131408691
it was very little less.	37.98678207397461
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	19.172609329223633
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	25.13323211669922
my mind was more
agreeably engaged.	38.855899810791016
well, any friend of
mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him."	41.817501068115234
you do not know what i suffer."	27.230833053588867
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to rosings.	91.81417846679688
"now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	46.52168655395508
jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.	80.53358459472656
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel
fitzwilliam.	44.007808685302734
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	23.82805824279785
"yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation!	38.286861419677734
1.f.	69.94020080566406
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets.	41.9908447265625
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	10.666913032531738
they are all for what they can get.	10.872775077819824
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	35.53199005126953
the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty.	16.730722427368164
_they_ will never be distressed
for money.	26.787195205688477
"yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	33.994197845458984
"yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	18.815322875976562
"good god!	32.78547668457031
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.	56.76884460449219
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	33.08689880371094
anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	23.359121322631836
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	73.11724090576172
they
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	33.08187484741211
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."	16.014877319335938
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in
vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	42.249752044677734
"oh!	37.7921257019043
in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	40.11734390258789
how acutely did she now
feel it.	34.59370422363281
"my dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	17.498075485229492
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	36.885528564453125
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what
i learnt, to my own family!	36.262603759765625
he knows of my
     being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy.	53.754554748535156
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	30.737977981567383
mrs bennet's best
comfort was, that mr bingley must be down again in the summer.	14.930863380432129
i cannot do justice to his kindness.	39.055912017822266
the death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	46.95695877075195
"i hope," added mrs gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.	36.123870849609375
i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."	22.014421463012695
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth.	93.07807922363281
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	44.24228286743164
"i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	20.505598068237305
accompanied by a violent yawn.	34.967681884765625
but what is that to me?	13.91067886352539
she approached, and saw
the likeness of mr wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	45.093772888183594
"can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?"	47.91222381591797
but as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	34.0098991394043
his disposition must
be dreadful."	26.313512802124023
elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	33.49488830566406
"wickham so
very bad!	44.17167663574219
he then handed her
in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.	36.34144973754883
i have told miss bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often
told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
mrs jenkinson's room.	37.6489372253418
"but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.	30.781225204467773
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	40.21268081665039
"your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr darcy."	32.18037796020508
"i have said no such thing.	43.17461013793945
elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.	20.429588317871094
i could not have parted with
you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy."	43.465660095214844
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	14.868285179138184
"he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."	157.2627716064453

but to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character!	36.89475631713867
how odious i should think them!"	26.87575912475586
good girl!	41.2971076965332
this
however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	26.199426651000977
he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	57.968116760253906
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	39.12431335449219
if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long.	22.77579689025879
"i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."	35.78335952758789
"he brought it with him for us to see."	81.61622619628906

the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s
regiment."	35.87810516357422
they were natural and just.	15.205378532409668
"yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	53.4249153137207
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in
address that he improves?	40.717132568359375
she was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
     herself.	41.5912971496582
this will never do."	24.763729095458984
and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road."	31.745258331298828
but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	55.977298736572266
"i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on, than
that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it
be not so, let mr darcy contradict it.	19.63392448425293
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	23.44444465637207
i can recal nothing worse.	32.15171813964844
said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
youngest, i'm the tallest."	29.722917556762695
what is the matter?"	30.016586303710938
his letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.	22.845722198486328
i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."	34.797183990478516
mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.	19.034711837768555
"i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."	34.10965347290039
but the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.	30.492717742919922
"you may well warn me against such an evil.	22.223827362060547
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	45.498111724853516
"pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing i believe.	27.210798263549805
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to london, before they procured lodgings.	29.998239517211914
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr
wickham's attentions.	25.11261558532715
the second began.	34.64280319213867
the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	27.033946990966797
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.	35.11574935913086
her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	41.85927963256836
"that is a question which mr darcy only can answer."	26.074216842651367
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	49.20339584350586
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	14.175264358520508
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	26.700212478637695
the
housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	33.91886520385742
"but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	33.4857063293457
"you are uniformly charming!"	48.14250946044922
as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	28.615205764770508
"_that_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness!	53.740535736083984
one may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	52.99705123901367
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.	19.450950622558594
why is not every body as happy?"	18.4766902923584
--and then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	24.98406219482422
she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.	21.624038696289062
what did colonel
forster say?	73.11724090576172
her ease and good
spirits increased.	7.12873649597168
they must be a great loss to _your_ family."	21.47039222717285
she is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished.	7.267383098602295
"oh!	69.40264129638672
both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	72.77320861816406
at that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	31.404653549194336
we neither of us perform to strangers."	34.896400451660156
"all!--what, all five out at once?	40.46868133544922
she added, "by far too much.	39.44679260253906
when mr
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte.	28.058889389038086
it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them
     both----"

"then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!"	28.671337127685547
for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions.	29.71109390258789
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?"	21.26088523864746
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
manner:--

"you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	53.09067153930664
"i wish it may."	111.953369140625
the
gentlemen did approach; and when mr wickham walked into the room,
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	12.816572189331055
these are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as i thought myself privileged, for you.	43.865867614746094
mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	32.98549270629883
well, well, i only hope it
will last.	33.75265884399414
till i
can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_."	37.068443298339844
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found.	58.26113510131836
i must find mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; i have not an instant to lose."	44.437896728515625
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
openly.	26.90843391418457
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	33.99884796142578
oh, brother,
how kind you are!	28.596508026123047
"yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be.	29.793447494506836
mr collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day.	27.91523551940918
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care.	35.59737014770508
i
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	38.49449920654297
"i am, dear sir, &c. &c."

mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	19.106386184692383
can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	28.730371475219727
"it is _not_ mr bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life."	39.23052978515625
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much.	40.7405891418457
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.	51.01746368408203
had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	25.789865493774414
"my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	53.08526611328125
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	35.07373809814453
since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	31.26483154296875
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."	39.607120513916016
she then took a large house in edward-street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	24.099592208862305
"these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature.	22.155153274536133
but in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy's
pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend mr denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	29.70231819152832
he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	30.84421157836914
with _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!	33.86392593383789
but now it comes out."	43.08938217163086
"colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	42.91139602661133
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"	80.53358459472656
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	42.68948745727539
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
