32.62188720703125
her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered?	20.89026641845703
"indeed!"	26.147525787353516
miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	21.24513053894043
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	43.26197052001953
"i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	27.37653350830078
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	23.405611038208008
i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading!	13.123083114624023
to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.	34.3077507019043
resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i
trust i am resigned.	21.33887481689453
i am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	80.52763366699219
does your
charge give you much trouble?	13.113062858581543
"i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth.	66.35662078857422
"i beg your pardon.	7.706684589385986
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	67.23405456542969
"oh, yes!	28.81658172607422
it only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	15.546087265014648
he studies too much for
words of four syllables.--do not you, darcy?"	55.491275787353516
they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	43.60098648071289
miss
bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	51.65399932861328
i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	18.872148513793945
oh, sister!	51.970123291015625
kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do.	40.7513427734375
"it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."	29.926204681396484
"if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	26.382936477661133
she shook her head.	5.653954029083252
in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the
minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	40.879520416259766
bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	15.785014152526855
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	23.278507232666016
"this is
wholly unexpected.	24.5948429107666
"gracechurch-street, monday,

     august 2.	21.599367141723633
she answered him with cold civility.	38.75844192504883
but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."	69.37005615234375
at present we
have nothing to guide us.	32.12445831298828
his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.	41.46078109741211
"my dear mr bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last?"	26.157285690307617
mr
collins then returned to elizabeth.	14.861608505249023
make
haste, and come down this moment."	31.934215545654297
but he found, in reply to
     this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	24.079111099243164
dear me!	18.583251953125
allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."	19.964874267578125
i hope she will turn out well."	10.651759147644043
of course, we hope that you will support the project
gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.	46.431541442871094
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master.	24.12362289428711
it was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.	21.356618881225586
mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	14.73814868927002
she looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest mary should be singing all night.	157.54054260253906
have you had any
flirting?	25.566781997680664
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	14.584541320800781
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has
too much truth.	27.509708404541016
when all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish.	26.082229614257812
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	31.687774658203125
but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	36.706363677978516
consider how important every moment is, in such a case."	36.344932556152344
my father and mother believe the worst,
     but i cannot think so ill of him.	45.254520416259766
"how abominable!--i wonder that the very
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty i must call it."	32.139286041259766
there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.	37.77178955078125
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	32.60625457763672
well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley.--but--good
lord!	25.575223922729492
my aunt philips came to longbourn
on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me.	41.44545364379883
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede.	17.585580825805664
miss darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	46.89603042602539
the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	68.60899353027344
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	44.58553695678711
"and _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london!	38.115745544433594
all was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	17.355567932128906
my dear charles, what do you mean?"	23.12448501586914
nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight.	27.26682472229004
what i have to say relates to
     poor lydia.	15.230655670166016
he does not
want abilities.	42.42970657348633
"you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	29.815889358520508
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	26.537935256958008
her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	36.042728424072266
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let mr collins and me have a little conversation together."	44.02037048339844
stay, stay, i will go myself.	9.167189598083496
"ah!	20.677936553955078
"and how impossible in others!"	58.40800094604492
it must be my uncle's doings!	38.07129669189453
with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	12.958285331726074
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy."	24.119850158691406
he had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--but bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point.	70.57817840576172
"i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing.	19.705276489257812
i am
perfectly satisfied.	28.244077682495117
he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	105.46444702148438
1.e.	40.1314697265625
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	13.13015365600586
his principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.	34.21135330200195
their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	41.89549255371094
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."	15.840605735778809
"dining out," said mrs bennet, "that is very unlucky."	30.809932708740234
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	26.73819923400879
it was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	14.66135025024414
yes--i understand you perfectly."	105.46444702148438
1.e.5.	26.157217025756836
yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.	8.491275787353516
with _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."	23.254316329956055
"yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word."	23.83814811706543
"well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	10.818338394165039
you alluded to something else.	17.335514068603516
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	22.794267654418945
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	30.733736038208008
"no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	50.4261474609375
he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	6.649367332458496
_she_ will not be able to help calling."	33.6506462097168
nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure and i do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it, your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	16.286714553833008
she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	77.97713470458984
she replied in the affirmative.	28.27204132080078
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	24.089269638061523
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."	18.883684158325195
she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	41.29934310913086
"i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	27.80587387084961
the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	34.46873474121094
well, monday morning came, and i was in
such a fuss!	27.562538146972656
it was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr darcy!	77.51655578613281
"has she been presented?	22.888439178466797
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	21.523500442504883
the others have been gone on to scarborough,
these three weeks."	19.191823959350586
shocking!"	15.641867637634277
so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	52.44263458251953
are the others coming out?"	53.48979949951172
"a place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	36.63103485107422
we all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	28.58066749572754
mr darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.	21.506744384765625
darcy was fixed in astonishment.	37.339664459228516
"it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	45.49211120605469
she will be taken good care of.	15.976058006286621
lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	32.384944915771484
to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what jane felt for bingley.	20.69493865966797
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	20.224607467651367
they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either."	21.664722442626953
"about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i
answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	40.06363296508789
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?	19.42116928100586
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it."	53.180763244628906
"it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	26.005905151367188
mr bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has
received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	25.577102661132812
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	20.57411003112793
"and i have another favour to ask.	32.5303840637207
your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."	20.294578552246094
young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	23.341569900512695
how he lived i know not.	16.05323028564453
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	53.010257720947266
though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was."	76.81754302978516
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	29.128732681274414
in the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
elizabeth, said,

"miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."	11.342190742492676
tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."	12.734017372131348
it will pass away soon enough."	26.639177322387695
widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she
deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	30.0986328125
what could she mean by
it?	20.988018035888672
what shall we do with him?	25.019742965698242
she then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,

"come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	23.04372787475586
we had better go into the
avenue."	35.084877014160156
the
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	92.54015350341797
you see on
what a footing we are.	18.312536239624023
ever since i have known it, i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it.	14.968591690063477
i am impatient to see him."	48.250186920166016
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before.	35.184879302978516
i cannot think of it without abhorrence."	41.36420440673828
she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be.	26.522972106933594
"oh!	32.168277740478516
the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."	18.33625030517578
i will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn."	15.464509010314941
cried mrs gardiner.	25.68389129638672
i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	18.576528549194336
the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.	38.648983001708984
i often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.	16.98038101196289
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	25.029193878173828
if the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.	36.77288055419922
"miss elizabeth bennet!"	16.650665283203125
mr bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at netherfield house.	23.82937240600586
georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	30.96098518371582
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	21.79436492919922
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	16.21702003479004
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	35.61610794067383
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	30.019582748413086
there was
another reason too for her opposition.	67.69559478759766
girls, can i do any
thing for you in meryton?	35.8510856628418
every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch.	24.703529357910156
"as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent
four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable."	34.614070892333984
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while mr darcy was attending them to their
carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	22.73211669921875
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	10.180356979370117
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	26.80402374267578
"yes, madam," said mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.	32.69844436645508
"we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	27.080801010131836
"while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--i
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	19.101932525634766
they will
ruin your happiness.	28.94035530090332
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	9.303485870361328
lady catherine seemed pleased.	22.622520446777344
my dear lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us.	41.86320877075195
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner
thought of him, and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	14.412915229797363
i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	13.79611873626709
every thing
that is charming!	55.82059860229492
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	61.611534118652344
"it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	50.73159408569336
"i have already told her so once, by your desire."	9.876975059509277

"it did.	25.005830764770508
my brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	34.46187210083008
your daughter
elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."	26.290876388549805
lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."	27.48650360107422
his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	29.41614532470703
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	46.562103271484375
"very well.	26.522972106933594
"oh!	25.18276596069336
the feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."	52.49250030517578
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.	20.953100204467773
elizabeth looked surprised.	16.291973114013672
said he, smiling.	43.74795913696289
"do not you want to know who has taken it?"	10.534577369689941
a single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year.	59.88884353637695

"what sort of a girl is miss darcy?"	24.480079650878906
i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."	20.29588508605957
"you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir."	60.41548156738281
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	46.63795852661133
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	26.291492462158203
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--mr bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.	64.52660369873047
"and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!	16.168434143066406

did you admire me for my impertinence?"	25.038862228393555

the very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	21.424015045166016
"you mistake me, my dear.	32.679351806640625
"not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."	4.894638538360596
"ah!"	27.157129287719727
the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	24.003803253173828
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."	29.250808715820312
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	14.311056137084961
it was all conjecture."	21.589065551757812
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his
wife?"	14.053498268127441
"mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	20.13852310180664
"for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."	41.60844802856445
for a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	27.235593795776367
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.	17.166730880737305
mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	28.10274314880371
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
netherfield.	18.858652114868164
mr denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, mr wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	30.352214813232422
though i
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
you."	29.759286880493164
i cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	28.480680465698242
on their being joined by mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	37.94050979614258
"come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	21.73517608642578
my reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	34.23400115966797
miss bingley was
engrossed by mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	39.98599624633789
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."	30.126970291137695
"there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel
fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in london.	28.547740936279297
"that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	28.461381912231445
"my dear mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	30.03272819519043
her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	8.993453979492188

"it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire.	37.163856506347656
the business was therefore soon settled.	22.163564682006836
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	30.55501937866211
his
attachment to rosings, certainly increases."	33.909820556640625
their reception at home was most kind.	31.132043838500977
"lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent.	28.119705200195312
it was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.	29.101285934448242
bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	23.886646270751953
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	29.727102279663086
but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be
     indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--these causes
     must be stated, though briefly.--the situation of your mother's
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you.	25.690994262695312
it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	24.632875442504883
you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	34.68886947631836
her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	24.176721572875977
"mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library."	44.89320755004883
"mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.	37.209842681884766
said her mother.	23.5330810546875
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	33.76926040649414
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.	23.36143684387207
then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	25.457046508789062
and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen pemberley."	21.3323974609375
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	38.27192306518555
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	28.281757354736328
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	36.86572265625
but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could."	19.49553680419922
pray read on."	45.12265396118164
her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	29.477169036865234
they attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas.	23.909446716308594
his debts are to be paid,
     amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased.	38.59001159667969
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	31.87278938293457
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be
dissuaded from it.	7.509725570678711
i mend
pens remarkably well."	24.20343017578125
she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."	48.61140441894531
now what have you to say?"	45.64213943481445
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect.	30.6342716217041
when the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	24.76993179321289
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?"	47.869667053222656
i am so happy.	50.04024887084961
after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "i _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	25.487567901611328
"do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	39.846092224121094
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	26.614330291748047
my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady
catherine.	17.032215118408203
_he_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."	6.643588066101074
elizabeth silently attended
her.	16.830860137939453
"true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	34.40388870239258
what will you think of my vanity?	26.68353271484375
she wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	31.962158203125
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	12.060286521911621

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.	52.938961029052734
and what sort of table do they keep?	23.789186477661133
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	21.50503921508789
no one made any reply.	43.47557067871094
"i have no right to give _my_ opinion," said wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	45.77143096923828
i will take care of
myself, and of mr wickham too.	37.63626480102539
she has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall i call it?	22.681306838989258
said mr gardiner.	39.8151741027832
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	39.55858612060547
it is what every body says.	23.53124237060547
"yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	27.78272819519043
their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	56.64303207397461
he replied, and was again silent.	4.693487644195557
her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."	18.052589416503906
a small sum could not do all this."	14.4313325881958
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	25.73050308227539
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	38.114444732666016
mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	17.194965362548828
on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	16.500890731811523
"don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake!	47.43280029296875
but my dear lydia, i don't
at all like your going such a way off.	27.62060546875
as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, mr darcy, and mr
darcy only, entered the room.	17.23211669921875
there was also a postscript to this
effect.	33.8381462097168
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady
catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."	18.940202713012695
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	18.061281204223633
"a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	39.22535705566406
"but not before they went to brighton?"	24.609209060668945
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	38.86957550048828
"perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	27.357421875
she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	11.619403839111328
that he has neither integrity nor honour.	21.53525161743164
"but the wife of mr
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."	44.039329528808594
"perhaps i do.	27.92136001586914
in the hall they parted.	26.235506057739258
is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	20.619672775268555
his brother-in-law, mr hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	28.18087387084961
jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	51.26919937133789
"there has
been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way.	56.5689582824707
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	39.65449905395508
catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.	39.49241638183594
are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	6.826564311981201
was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	43.9078483581543
my
watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.	19.817136764526367
we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.	38.662166595458984
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	27.212297439575195
however, if you provide access to or

as it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	25.46055030822754
"are you not diverted?"	37.07787322998047
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?"	28.35602569580078
said mrs bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	11.003206253051758
i am most seriously displeased."	32.79879379272461
"next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky."	66.58534240722656
the power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	23.18806266784668
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"you are mistaken, mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."	14.18440055847168
"yes, she will remain there till christmas."	37.078460693359375
some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening.	45.62637710571289
at last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	39.33918762207031
"she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property."	55.80683517456055
it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	45.20610046386719
"certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am
not one of _them_.	23.517852783203125
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	32.784751892089844
howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined
     by mrs collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter,
     to whom i have related the affair.	25.470008850097656
i depend on you for that."	28.768712997436523
after a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	35.55495071411133
i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother
lady catherine.	40.5897102355957
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.	44.880191802978516
she has two nieces
of her own.	33.048316955566406
lydia came to
     us; and wickham had constant admission to the house.	28.298402786254883
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday.	23.373777389526367
well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	56.082801818847656
i always said it must be so, at last.	22.714195251464844
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	50.100833892822266
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"	50.34135055541992
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.	40.46141815185547
"an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth.	12.868376731872559
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	25.351409912109375
why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"	36.91802215576172
i wish i could see her.	30.377107620239258
it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	19.10492515563965
respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.	37.31831359863281
"_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza," said
charlotte.	19.292774200439453
i am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.	23.14037322998047
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	12.500029563903809
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.	36.27324295043945
the motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him.	23.467885971069336
we have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."	26.2217960357666
"you forget that i have made no
answer.	34.437496185302734
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	36.2774658203125
"but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	31.091768264770508
"no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise."	55.51430130004883
who
are your uncles and aunts?	26.51232147216797
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.	80.86579132080078
"i do not know.	67.14108276367188
and poor mr darcy!	43.96416091918945
such
doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly.	44.537071228027344
the loo table, however, did not appear.	9.013763427734375
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	30.977588653564453
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	57.87620162963867
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!	31.156339645385742
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	28.2253360748291
when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	26.867891311645508
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	48.7783203125
he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	38.44083786010742
"i desire you will do no such thing.	19.31427574157715
they may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."	41.42622756958008
"i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	43.49260330200195
"what, has she frightened away
some of your lovers?	28.221338272094727
and when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "i shall insist on their giving one also.	32.54312515258789
she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters.	26.301742553710938
miss
bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?	38.079654693603516
would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	43.3644905090332
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	30.726242065429688
her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	28.117401123046875
in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	41.74309539794922
it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in."	25.01030921936035
"did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	35.214447021484375
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."	22.961952209472656
every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	3.096687078475952
james's?"	16.54868507385254
i hope we
may often meet again."	23.315767288208008
after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, mr collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.	23.176706314086914
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	18.263351440429688
_your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.	21.92058563232422
our distress, my
     dear lizzy, is very great.	41.28781509399414
i thought i should have died.	42.35866928100586
many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i
despair.	27.264535903930664
"his father was an excellent man," said mrs gardiner.	25.757850646972656
"but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."	23.08877944946289
mr darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	61.17788314819336
the apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	15.553449630737305
it is admirable!"	33.667327880859375
lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	22.583711624145508
her colour
changed, and she said no more.	25.21778678894043
it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	20.422897338867188

the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	21.09665870666504
are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?	42.4586181640625
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	110.07908630371094
i am very, very sorry.	22.778295516967773

"when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."	41.71360397338867
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	31.07478141784668
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time.	25.025129318237305
"he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"	44.57161331176758
she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	46.663448333740234
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	50.39611053466797
"i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about mr wickham.	33.158878326416016
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	20.98079490661621
the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street.	44.0830192565918
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	25.156909942626953
for my part, i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.	30.432601928710938
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.	12.486893653869629
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	5.789096355438232
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."	22.56608009338379
here comes hill.	53.95049285888672
in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.	28.239564895629883
it mortifies me.	20.381906509399414
mr collins and charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	35.3696403503418
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him.	14.490704536437988
with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr wickham and the
officers, mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	15.04030990600586
the reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	48.27170181274414
scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	27.665599822998047
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	32.48264694213867
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would
     write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	30.29549789428711
"shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to
befall her?"	27.154312133789062
i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."	8.667684555053711
yes, i call it a _very_ easy distance."	27.52003288269043
you have no compassion on my poor nerves."	33.906219482421875
she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged mr collins's conversation to herself.	38.52272033691406
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.	30.44184112548828
the
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was elizabeth's intimate friend.	69.32894897460938
you will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	24.15329360961914
"_that_ you certainly shall."	34.0993537902832
from his garden, mr collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	40.379703521728516
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."	32.504390716552734
but will they make you happy?"	9.478811264038086
you must and shall be married by a special licence.	48.18152618408203
say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.	11.62117862701416
"when is your next ball to be, lizzy?"	30.095983505249023
i defy even sir william lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	34.76325988769531
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs
bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly."	24.953672409057617
the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	10.402523040771484
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help.	12.295571327209473
she
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	21.695545196533203
to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	23.185014724731445
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	43.02927017211914
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.	38.64021301269531
where, where is my uncle?"	25.532352447509766
but the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."	31.735488891601562
we know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	23.78118133544922
pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	21.141355514526367
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty.	34.556522369384766
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	33.300418853759766
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	40.25258255004883
unfortunately an only son, for many years an only _child_
i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable, allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	20.709123611450195
mr bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	49.41525650024414
you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them."	20.20760726928711
"not yet," replied jane.	46.84834671020508
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	28.914966583251953
all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	36.29206085205078
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
that you should come together.	35.88246536254883
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	25.148775100708008
she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	16.219444274902344
but
my dearest love, tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of,
that i may have it to-morrow."	24.442941665649414
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	26.438140869140625
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	27.590547561645508
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the
     address specified in section 4, "information about donations to
     the project gutenberg literary archive foundation."	26.691843032836914
let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	29.01485252380371
she will
make him a very proper wife."	24.915462493896484
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	25.047176361083984
"mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling.	33.514888763427734
it cannot be concealed from any one.	22.231782913208008
when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	8.25104808807373
"if you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	32.691688537597656
i hate such false
friends.	30.37453842163086
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.	44.250587463378906
here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	40.38971710205078
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	33.336952209472656
"poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!	30.033235549926758
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	9.728154182434082
but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet.	25.1991024017334
there was no want of discourse.	42.44778823852539
its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	34.44236373901367
"is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?"	58.595184326171875
"could i expect it to be otherwise!"	73.18913269042969
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	35.04326248168945
"indeed i have, sir," was her answer.	13.772623062133789
"and have you answered the letter?"	68.08903503417969
i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	31.05290412902832
he
arranges the business just as he pleases."	29.068103790283203
but he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not.	39.238033294677734
"but i was embarrassed."	29.265972137451172
"my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	41.601165771484375
"but depend upon it, mr collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be
brought to reason.	37.59642791748047
had she not seen him in
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	27.413135528564453
their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	11.570454597473145
i shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance i require."	30.717727661132812
"these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth.	31.808746337890625
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."	31.928022384643555
"_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it."	30.49856185913086
i do not know the
particulars, but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	25.70107078552246
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can
assure you, he informed me himself."	23.13868522644043
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.	23.39023780822754
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	20.5181884765625
i shall be back by dinner."	32.940921783447266
_that_ is all settled."	25.078868865966797
instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them."	17.557796478271484
but as to your
other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.	53.313575744628906
mr philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.	38.33247375488281
she answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	17.53190803527832
he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.	30.550838470458984
"yes; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	26.155513763427734
brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton."	31.830795288085938
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	28.131696701049805
an union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	30.64731216430664
yes--it would be much better to
wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again.	11.988554954528809
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	34.75889205932617
where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	28.543893814086914
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"engaged to mr collins!	35.44582748413086
her ladyship was highly incensed.	22.726215362548828
as
for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	31.04521369934082
what
     he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again
     to-morrow evening.	54.91745376586914
it is mr wickham's intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	30.469497680664062
"my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	31.033668518066406
"you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	44.810245513916016
"when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--oh!	36.729698181152344
they agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family.	41.08976364135742
"i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter!"	27.245405197143555
"my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"	20.106597900390625
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	14.536162376403809
copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.	27.91370391845703
how unlucky!	30.001991271972656
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings.	28.456592559814453
she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	19.987396240234375
i am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr darcy's
regard."	29.319721221923828
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	37.215789794921875
bromley, of course.--if you mention my name at the bell,
you will be attended to."	37.84456253051758
i did not know before, that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	57.223995208740234
is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	9.282946586608887
"my motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	22.966781616210938
"take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	34.661346435546875
mr wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr collins for
a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.	30.351213455200195
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."	43.604976654052734
after tea, mr bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument.	36.346649169921875
what say you,
mary?	32.71678924560547
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."	24.23384666442871
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire.	42.42293167114258
"it is more than i engage for, i assure you."	37.0079345703125
they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	31.460081100463867
said her aunt.	10.799171447753906
they are not married,
     nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
     your side, i hope it will not be long before they are.	27.03780174255371
consider mr collins's respectability, and
charlotte's prudent, steady character.	31.066801071166992
"your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	29.76473617553711
having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	15.709518432617188
they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs
bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what elizabeth felt.	27.300355911254883
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."	15.64028549194336
in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	34.4716911315918
it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	27.39353370666504
mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	26.101957321166992
"you may as well call it impertinence at once.	59.87467956542969
had i known what
i ought, what i dared, to do!	18.004047393798828
he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	24.857778549194336
"you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	43.8931999206543
she had been unwilling to
mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.	50.639312744140625
his fear of her, has always operated, i
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he
has very much at heart."	32.83186340332031
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	41.62275695800781
mrs bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	31.615745544433594
young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."	26.105045318603516
long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	19.578994750976562
"you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	70.63195037841797
"and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	46.72882843017578
but, lizzy!	12.666813850402832
he had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other
     person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions.	22.326507568359375
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	25.463851928710938
many small donations
$1 to $5,000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.	32.304107666015625
her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	29.196176528930664
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	52.38418960571289
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	30.05499267578125
she
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	14.764616012573242
mr gardiner declared his
willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	10.711468696594238
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.	22.52618980407715
cried elizabeth.	16.385169982910156
"no governess!	17.861644744873047
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when mr denny comes back from town."	30.326778411865234
on the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	34.84832000732422
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.	20.7702579498291
"dear lizzy!"	27.987781524658203
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	35.77006912231445
but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--mr bingley will not be detained in london by
them."	15.42126750946045
and as i come back, i can call on
lady lucas and mrs long.	5.656923294067383
if an individual project gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder, the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees
or charges.	31.71611976623535
it is nearly fifty miles."	26.470043182373047
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	9.850319862365723
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty.	2.3219902515411377
mr bennet treated the matter differently.	36.28989791870117
lord!	58.7398681640625
i never saw such a long chin in my life.	19.961261749267578
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	35.39741134643555
what a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"	33.62321853637695
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."	16.976022720336914
is she handsome?"	71.33090209960938
the foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united
states.	30.993621826171875
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	25.202547073364258
it gives me pain
to speak ill of a darcy.	30.957645416259766
charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.	26.522972106933594
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy."	80.82854461669922
"oh!	23.96493148803711
and now here's mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight
wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	47.00061798095703
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	43.48418426513672
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too!	17.80364227294922
and when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	35.1795539855957
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	19.839845657348633
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	27.278841018676758
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	38.1546745300293
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	49.13697814941406
"my dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	37.64210891723633
he scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	40.23655319213867
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.	37.20922088623047
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	19.53352165222168
unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	60.42835998535156
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	35.24724578857422
i promised
them so faithfully!	49.621402740478516
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"	60.16831970214844
"nothing child, nothing.	22.1210994720459
the first week of their return was soon gone.	24.175464630126953
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	20.515235900878906
in short,
i will do my best."	17.193445205688477
but our visitor
     was very obstinate.	28.04753303527832
to
put me on my guard?	30.709733963012695
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	43.17327117919922
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	33.61158752441406
"what is mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?	55.02518844604492
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr denny had
brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	21.58509635925293
at such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	17.930543899536133
she
had ventured only one glance at darcy.	33.97773742675781
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which i have never acknowledged.	14.91227912902832
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	42.97557830810547
i will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."	51.7725830078125
"that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	23.450363159179688
"come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance.	30.160337448120117
she was gone directly.	26.506488800048828
i am
going away myself."	59.56817626953125
"certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	25.461095809936523
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	35.72385025024414
even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and
monday, endurable to kitty and lydia.	94.00708770751953
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do.	34.55497360229492
how are you all?"	13.3961820602417
"miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	23.91973304748535
the officers will find
women better worth their notice.	47.077510833740234
lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	30.438528060913086
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	25.386205673217773
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated
elopement.	33.405120849609375
bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	56.69137191772461
they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

"come, mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	75.44913482666016
"no, not at all."	37.80453109741211
i should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.	30.668149948120117
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	42.9087028503418
"i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	64.62187194824219
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	10.753949165344238
had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	18.879379272460938
i want to talk very seriously.	34.74480056762695
and his sisters are charming women.	39.79183578491211
"the conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved
in civility."	25.017061233520508
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	37.05051803588867
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	26.791500091552734
what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	45.72283935546875
the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine.	55.818519592285156
"i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister philips.	19.362831115722656
lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."	16.90911293029785
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton, these visitors came.	28.068506240844727
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly
calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	36.04003143310547
i do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
     be deceived again.	27.078800201416016
"did you go by the village of kympton?"	58.304710388183594
this is the estimation in which you hold me!	43.02397918701172
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	25.650737762451172
and rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr collins thus
addressed her,

"when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."	29.379640579223633
our poor mother
     is sadly grieved.	31.4034366607666
"oh, lizzy!	24.580825805664062
her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	40.130802154541016
with many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for mrs bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"good lord!	38.8411979675293
but at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.	33.191707611083984
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.	32.80902862548828
you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."	34.60401153564453
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	57.23084259033203
but the fact is, that
being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, who, however, may live many years longer, i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
for several years.	20.4991397857666
but in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.	33.70952224731445
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	19.54010581970215
"i do not pretend to
regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	31.68410873413086
information about the mission of project gutenberg-tm

project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.	37.21506881713867
while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	10.676253318786621
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.	36.00952911376953
a
most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house!	99.13260650634766
my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
as i might have done!	33.73690414428711
"from the former.	22.086591720581055
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!	33.17433547973633
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	19.209749221801758
my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	45.21583557128906
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	26.34361457824707
"my dear, you flatter me.	71.79810333251953
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	113.1683578491211
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	37.58765411376953
but, alas!	2.345947742462158
mr darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr bingley
never stirs without him."	28.2150936126709
[illustration: morning dress.	39.655574798583984
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	15.91589069366455
mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone mr collins began.	38.615875244140625
mr darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	40.21302795410156
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your
     attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
     demand it of your justice.	19.57948875427246
the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than mr bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.	28.817764282226562
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia.	24.553871154785156
she was
sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	31.757469177246094
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am
_not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things."	28.8714656829834
they were ignorant, idle, and vain.	48.23849868774414
mr bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. mrs bennet was quite
disconcerted.	37.049922943115234
"do you really think so?"	33.16783905029297
"and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty.	25.945207595825195
but,
my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	33.00623321533203
for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	30.8095645904541
what a fine thing for our girls!"	24.205425262451172
she wrote even
to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	15.12473201751709
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"miss elizabeth bennet."	28.822805404663086
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the project gutenberg-tm
collection.	36.958919525146484
without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.	28.986082077026367
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	42.423336029052734
you tear them to pieces."	24.637285232543945
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	56.671260833740234
she comes to us to-day.	27.146446228027344
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	51.49757385253906
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs long," said miss lucas, "but i
wish he had danced with eliza."	25.802663803100586
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	33.71321487426758
i shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on.	23.477067947387695
to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	18.836307525634766
perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	28.0367374420166
i cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done."	29.773210525512695
the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
dovedale, or the peak.	51.95123291015625
as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	31.79522132873535
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	44.09703063964844
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.	48.31843185424805
in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	39.72257995605469
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."	21.510143280029297
"i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen.	42.437557220458984
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	49.44749069213867
the hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.	22.865970611572266
but do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	34.1465950012207
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	34.388126373291016
she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.	21.535812377929688
i was very
uncomfortable, i may say unhappy.	15.446555137634277
four nieces
of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	32.41517639160156
so tall!--oh, my
dear lizzy!	37.989349365234375
yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
first, you may remember."	18.60832977294922
my father bears it better.	50.03010177612305
"upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	44.044525146484375
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion.	34.1444091796875
sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	105.46444702148438
not a syllable was uttered by either; and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	28.64242935180664
1.f.6.	28.615009307861328
the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh!	37.68891143798828
his marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy."	39.46195983886719
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth.	23.932958602905273
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	31.847929000854492
mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	20.692312240600586
i wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if i had not asked you!	15.575630187988281
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley.	34.0181770324707
"i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked.	41.116085052490234
the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings.	35.05379104614258
"the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."	39.585418701171875
if you'll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight.	41.089866638183594
till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	28.593017578125
"why, my dear, you must know, mrs long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."	347.04486083984375
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	28.842117309570312
only think!	34.06772994995117
"your's sincerely, &c."

miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	21.89242935180664
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."	23.241579055786133
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	28.654409408569336
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.	37.51805114746094
i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr
darcy."	49.052486419677734
"i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr collins was wishing to
marry you.	38.527645111083984
"but does lydia know nothing of this?	50.74800109863281
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	45.131656646728516
as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	33.81606674194336
my visit was
not long, as caroline and mrs hurst were going out.	30.398046493530273
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	32.176544189453125
such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.	32.84861755371094
but she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.	4.326714038848877
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.	40.06159973144531
no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	62.38935852050781
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	28.52605628967285
'tis as good as a lord!	39.086669921875
on
mr and mrs gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	19.8817195892334
the least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	21.434789657592773
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	29.74439811706543
this invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	32.44450378417969
we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun!	32.98735427856445
"yes, she did."	25.829317092895508
and turning round, he looked for a moment at
elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	36.715702056884766
mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	31.952953338623047
"no more have i," said mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."	63.37855529785156
a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but mr darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	1.8288949728012085
"the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	36.24704360961914
oh!	34.1790771484375
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	33.271026611328125
she says lizzy had better have taken mr
collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	66.69515991210938
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	37.761226654052734
the reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as i have given above.	42.34076690673828
mr darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.	36.210487365722656
his appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	40.106712341308594
but is it
certain, absolutely certain?"	23.955774307250977
she was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr darcy,
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.	29.10300064086914
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it."	33.03386688232422
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	36.845863342285156
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
from netherfield, and was opened immediately.	31.746675491333008
you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, i am sure you did.	23.722753524780273
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

"what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam?	36.221412658691406
said
jane.--"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her."	53.75892639160156
"it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	23.98832893371582
have you heard from my uncle?"	38.97975158691406
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."	28.430896759033203
her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,

"i can guess the subject of your reverie."	26.546310424804688
and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	26.08836555480957
it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	29.585786819458008
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs
bennet instantly answered,

"oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am
sure she can have no objection.--come, kitty, i want you up stairs."	33.849395751953125
what relates to yourself, is as follows.	64.82655334472656
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	29.696212768554688
"'tis an etiquette i despise," said he.	40.77550506591797
she was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.	23.436920166015625
"aye, there she comes," continued mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided
she can have her own way.--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_i_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i
told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	24.565893173217773
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look
on as a point of duty.	27.424236297607422
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
mrs bennet give up the point.	35.897090911865234
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	34.425601959228516
"thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you
all, and then wickham would be angry."	31.25972557067871
"if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it."	22.574012756347656
of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself.	38.95044708251953
well, how pleased i am!	20.427412033081055
"i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.	55.97187805175781
every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.	30.560768127441406
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	97.73727416992188
their powers of conversation were considerable.	29.51909065246582
i know not what to think.	51.81539535522461
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	16.721548080444336
i have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older."	48.60634231567383
"removed!"	45.36928176879883
but there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	48.9765739440918
their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach.	17.53207015991211
mrs long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.	19.714445114135742
hear me in silence.	18.28687858581543

had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."	34.59492111206055
has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	27.904712677001953
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	26.708860397338867
i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."	36.282230377197266
"he is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	46.60379409790039
i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner.	13.078983306884766
"they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	76.81146240234375
but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	79.71546936035156
"indeed i am.	38.5623664855957
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	21.048799514770508
he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	23.86927604675293
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."	28.633790969848633
mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	31.014413833618164
"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
all."	23.52423667907715
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	18.174787521362305
who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	17.010690689086914
"has your governess left you?"	20.245323181152344
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days.	31.50682258605957
i understand that mr collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	18.09074592590332
i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	37.512176513671875
had it been your uncle's doing, i must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	68.8832015991211
the business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	39.32180404663086
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon.	34.7811279296875
i was ready to die of laughter.	35.801090240478516
a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	46.25220489501953
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	43.5826301574707
"perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	37.491573333740234
perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now.	156.78387451171875
when
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	36.98403549194336
"and so was i."	28.606107711791992
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him
ever since he was four years old."	42.61888122558594
are
you going much farther?"	34.15167999267578
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma?	36.6737060546875
"oh, jane,
take care."	27.930253982543945
he was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	28.1997013092041
mrs bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by
the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
meryton.	26.225505828857422
i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	20.810314178466797
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	24.757633209228516
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished.	13.720796585083008
has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	80.01408386230469
people do not die of little
trifling colds.	70.71370697021484
"exceed their income!	26.185726165771484
i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	23.219728469848633
"what could become of mr bingley and jane!"	26.27157211303711
it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."	32.38922882080078
"then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."	19.39976692199707
"about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i
understand."	28.320987701416016
"i must not decide on my own performance."	35.15012741088867
i knew how it
would be.	39.54315948486328
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	88.95677947998047
"mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."	32.445960998535156
"la!	27.244489669799805
"you are too hasty, sir," she cried.	33.79103088378906
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of
superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas."	30.20011329650879
at our time of life, it is not so
pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	26.522972106933594
the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	15.501317977905273
"oh!	27.649599075317383
mrs
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party.	23.81024932861328
only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	38.69822311401367
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	37.00236892700195
they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration.	44.49766159057617
"yes, in conjunction with his friend."	17.04648208618164
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
her resigned.	24.570178985595703
dear lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	33.916316986083984
"la!"	33.59528350830078
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her."	35.70392608642578
can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	17.040536880493164
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them.	33.83111572265625
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"	28.5742130279541
they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	35.56061935424805
i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	26.463947296142578
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr
darcy and herself.	30.157398223876953
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	30.354652404785156
mrs gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	39.28019714355469
that such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."	38.86063766479492
when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	17.875280380249023
"i suspected as much," replied elizabeth.	28.76883888244629
cried he, turning towards her.	28.51538848876953
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	28.841331481933594
"it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."	26.5738525390625
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	49.23648452758789
though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.	52.751625061035156
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	27.617238998413086
at length, she spoke again.	27.063417434692383
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.	51.33021926879883
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr
collins too!--why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"	27.625953674316406
they could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	27.456710815429688
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?"	40.50506591796875
said she.	19.3099308013916
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "oh!	38.92146682739258
your
reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.'	5.989217281341553
lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
good humoured as lydia.	43.26940155029297

pride and prejudice:

a novel.	19.60331153869629
but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	43.75884246826172
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	52.100589752197266
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	14.093009948730469
"and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	21.591798782348633
colonel forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon.	25.583740234375
my father is going to
     london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her.	37.98575973510742
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	30.95347785949707
our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----you shall try it
some day.--do your sisters play and sing?"	84.80660247802734
"yes, she called yesterday with her father.	55.95992660522461
he delighted in
going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	31.427780151367188
but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	23.626129150390625
miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	23.35458755493164
"indeed i do not dare."	30.279434204101562
so imprudent a
     match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood.	40.74675369262695
could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?	15.845035552978516
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg-tm
license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1.	43.67860794067383
her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	41.795623779296875
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."	36.7586555480957
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.	58.94095993041992
all that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum.	19.262277603149414
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	14.57951831817627
these recollections will not do at
all.	36.30238723754883
"let us sit down.	28.15262222290039
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on wednesday or thursday.	37.48023986816406
"it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."

"that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	49.041893005371094
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	34.18205642700195
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	23.746429443359375
"she is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	35.75935745239258
i cannot quite agree with you _there_.	20.414152145385742
she was teazed by
mr collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.	33.935489654541016
"if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to
understand it.	39.50520324707031
more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	28.203754425048828
"but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
every thing will be well."	34.34239196777344
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	48.45109176635742
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	40.60667037963867
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!	163.51773071289062
miss bingley i am sure cannot.	44.24517059326172
"what is there of good to be expected?"	346.098876953125
"i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	42.482242584228516
"and this is your real opinion!	24.067195892333984
believe her to be deceived by all means.	18.692049026489258
one day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	31.64754867553711
a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and mrs bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.	36.326454162597656
she received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.	11.913947105407715
"insolent girl!"	74.4900894165039
things are settled so
oddly."	31.763580322265625
"what did you say of me, that i did not deserve?	26.900606155395508
the officer was the very
mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	59.75340270996094
before any answer could arrive from mr collins, or any congratulations
to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.	36.041507720947266
it was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	26.522972106933594
on entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	26.297693252563477
"oh!	40.8509521484375
"while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mr
bingley."	23.17425537109375
"another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with _him_,
if i were you."	73.6793212890625
adieu.	35.97294616699219
"why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley.	31.480552673339844
"wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as jane's."	40.399051666259766
wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.	21.10822105407715
"but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."	38.64698791503906
"i never saw any one so shocked.	34.21239471435547
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	29.89466667175293
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	32.6026611328125
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	19.40225601196289
he had never had the
slightest suspicion.	42.02186965942383
"my dear father, i congratulate you."	31.354455947875977
she was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself.	29.382638931274414
"i am going
to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows."	36.64863967895508
"it is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	42.58770751953125
one
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	19.38288688659668
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	36.473777770996094
but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from the want of money.	53.10298156738281
your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."	47.708744049072266
come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.	34.50495147705078
i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield.	8.432250022888184
this was
very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	30.995807647705078
i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."	36.141563415527344
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object.	36.93778610229492
now, lizzy, i think i _have_
surprised you.	35.74665069580078
but, however, he is very welcome to
come to netherfield, if he likes it.	31.078079223632812
"do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa, you will not mind my
waking mr hurst."	57.24263000488281
my father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	32.42399597167969
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.	17.520240783691406
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	15.817998886108398
mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	149.13449096679688
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said
elizabeth.	40.215171813964844
"from mr collins!	49.40446472167969
elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	46.61566925048828
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	35.351505279541016
another day i will do the same; i will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as i can,--or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away."	53.977210998535156
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	21.04526710510254
"i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"	41.45442581176758
here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	29.826589584350586
she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	34.40229797363281
let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr
darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has
treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner.	27.68276596069336
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	30.700143814086914
my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	43.83026123046875
he had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us.	23.342805862426758
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once.	135.78933715820312
what congratulations will
then flow in!	29.760486602783203
he has
children of his own, and may have more.	38.208282470703125
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	1.8288949728012085
she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	26.135112762451172
oh!	23.73279571533203
but you have chosen your fault well.--i
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	22.427034378051758
he has not an ill-natured
look.	56.659881591796875
"i honour your circumspection.	23.230432510375977
i owe all that i know
of it, to another, not to you."	34.319766998291016
and she rose as she spoke.	26.017669677734375
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again.	34.94056701660156
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane, who were dancing together.	25.55423927307129
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	27.75361442565918
what does he say?	33.3257942199707
it needed all
jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.	34.43302917480469
elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	36.75107192993164
from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry mr collins, and i will never see you again
if you _do_."	254.0268096923828
i am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	53.92805099487305
"as often as i can.	31.274553298950195
but
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	16.638174057006836
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley.	22.897415161132812
mrs long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	12.367653846740723
lord, how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty!	32.714439392089844
mrs bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."	28.43685531616211
the
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	37.731292724609375
"you have insulted me, in every possible method.	9.445693969726562
"very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	19.277549743652344
it was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	37.665069580078125
you must not suspect me.	40.345985412597656
"it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	68.69056701660156
his character
     was to speak for itself.	33.04914855957031
indeed, mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	50.76246643066406
"no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."	19.148292541503906
i have written to colonel forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which i have pledged myself.	67.0434799194336
but you do not know _all_.	36.629920959472656
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	86.47102355957031
"yes, sir, i know i am.	19.4887752532959
she related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	34.84144973754883
on both sides it was only assertion.	29.61625862121582
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.	31.684282302856445
how he must have felt it!"	47.9643440246582
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant.	25.67256736755371
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear
     wickham, you must be very happy.	17.208740234375
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	34.39602279663086
"his misfortunes!"	29.941600799560547
well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	21.808773040771484
cried mrs bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	29.969926834106445
the note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	24.021404266357422
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	18.537620544433594

when she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.	54.73002243041992
at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	33.055728912353516
what am i to do?"	33.94440460205078
"he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."	39.63771438598633
"your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."	59.30562210083008
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	48.60042190551758
she was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr
darcy, she was directly retreating.	34.64362716674805
her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	40.734683990478516
my temper i dare not vouch
for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	23.135610580444336
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	52.917598724365234
"may i ask to what these questions tend?"	58.245361328125
my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	18.560413360595703
"this is a wretched beginning indeed!	39.46780776977539
excuse me--for i must speak plainly.	69.90496063232422
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	28.273408889770508
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	33.014373779296875
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	38.64032745361328
there was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	26.522972106933594
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added kitty.	32.743408203125
"oh!	52.98940658569336
in short, my dear aunt, i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	105.46444702148438
you are not going to be _missish_, i
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	18.34587860107422
1.e.6.	26.563207626342773
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!	36.2735481262207
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	29.373552322387695
elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	42.25086975097656
her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity.	262.3450622558594
"so, lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love i find.	47.35989761352539
"you did!	26.767284393310547
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.	13.573589324951172
i must speak to hill, this moment."	42.89469909667969
does she live near you, sir?"	287.41571044921875
"my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women's do.	26.669235229492188
"money!	44.65843200683594
day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	87.74537658691406
"oh, no!"	39.01838684082031
"not at all.	22.80323600769043
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr bingley.	28.290552139282227
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	30.195772171020508
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long.	31.06916046142578
the feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	42.38344955444336
those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	48.658111572265625
then, the two third he danced with miss
king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----"

"if he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much!	15.569289207458496
he owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	24.220674514770508
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	22.708629608154297
"you have said quite enough, madam.	45.796077728271484
i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	30.326528549194336
we are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	22.702939987182617
the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.	35.99128341674805
i really do not think georgiana
darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	60.3729133605957
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i
hope, though you have but a short lease."	26.522972106933594
she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter.	35.003517150878906
"oh!	39.12181091308594
she has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."	96.22530364990234
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.	26.522972106933594
what is to become of us!	20.11612319946289
"oh!	28.863901138305664
i told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	44.901363372802734
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	43.26527786254883
she had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.	22.697818756103516
mr darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."	24.488773345947266
but it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham.	17.276700973510742
"my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.	24.391386032104492
"how should you have liked making sermons?"	28.93597412109375
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds
was of no trifling nature.	39.96562957763672
i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name.	32.48678207397461
"only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."	27.1766357421875
when tea was over, mr hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	54.98888397216797
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly."	46.5937614440918
here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	37.209354400634766
"my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street."	29.656993865966797
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs bennet.--they had several children.	41.40480422973633
such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	23.768781661987305
"well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	51.177799224853516
"in the first place," replied mr gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland."	39.94865036010742
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another mr collins in time."	22.728668212890625
there
is nothing he would not do for her."	25.01300048828125
as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs bennet followed her,
saying,

"i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	19.072057723999023
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"oh!	30.433101654052734
my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.	48.11284637451172
miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.	38.166587829589844
she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.	39.17388153076172
had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	63.439815521240234
they are gone down to
newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, i do not know how long.	11.504724502563477
she saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	34.33304214477539
miss darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	10.711468696594238
"and may i ask?"	63.481117248535156
cried elizabeth.	39.486942291259766
the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	28.60806655883789
and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and mrs bennet, i am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.	1.8288949728012085
nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	50.626468658447266
oh!	38.07403564453125
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's
looks and behaviour.	78.10076141357422
but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	41.5590705871582
so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.	37.65757369995117
the whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	29.255020141601562
he now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
well as of mr darcy.	27.496482849121094
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	24.76841926574707
but mr bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	34.0427360534668
that _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	34.11533737182617
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	11.573177337646484
if she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.	37.94806671142578
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.
unless a copyright notice is included.	25.25286293029785
cried he.	34.391292572021484
"yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	165.22149658203125
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"i am not."	56.21190643310547
"i hope not so.	52.90229415893555
but it must not, shall not be.	38.650882720947266
they insist also on
     my seeing mr jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.	94.48565673828125
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.	43.920902252197266
what felicity!	39.575897216796875
she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	27.13275718688965
i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had."	14.780537605285645
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr darcy by
character perfectly well.	32.46424865722656
though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	42.976173400878906
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	38.09257125854492
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	22.99445152282715
elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.	24.85673713684082
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	53.17674255371094
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	20.180248260498047
she enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	41.6471061706543
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	24.841094970703125
*       *       *       *       *

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	44.691837310791016
our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."	32.50967025756836
the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	26.032033920288086
by supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.	25.981494903564453
"have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"	46.803531646728516
"but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that mrs long has promised to introduce him."	17.96000099182129
his pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by.	31.89731216430664
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	14.883017539978027
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.	20.68387794494629
who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after
your arrival!"	44.649269104003906
their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
at pemberley, before they left the country.	40.93223571777344
it was only said, 'lately,
george wickham, esq.	20.62352180480957
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	25.013927459716797
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.	41.815162658691406
well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next?	16.05898094177246
repeated miss bingley.	12.346012115478516
generous, good man, i am afraid he has
distressed himself.	19.80841636657715
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.	36.01173782348633
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	30.44294548034668
you have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.	30.293373107910156
who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	21.770719528198242
mr collins made his
declaration in form.	47.958003997802734
i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?"	30.09542465209961
and there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	66.422119140625
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated.	36.548099517822266
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	33.35140609741211
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"	52.01247787475586
any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far."	3.83144211769104
she is quite a little
creature.	33.673583984375
wretched, wretched, mistake!"	15.588133811950684
"she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."	40.43364334106445
mr bennet made no answer.	25.11515235900879
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	19.006908416748047
"and they _must_ marry!	34.08561325073242
"you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	55.1795768737793
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	31.4518985748291
her many attractions were again dwelt on, and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.	32.89033508300781
she had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	57.63368606567383
on the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me?	33.98225402832031
"mrs collins, you must send a servant with them.	49.734893798828125
"but,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	29.783554077148438
she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs hurst and
miss bingley.	33.37885284423828
we were
married, you know, at st. clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	34.50967025756836
"and then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	13.727442741394043
the first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached
     mr bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr
     wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--but
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--if, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry.--the
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i
     had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with
     others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the
     dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that
     ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made
     acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that
     bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage.	32.77357482910156
they
followed her into the dining-parlour.	107.11520385742188
but mrs
bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	24.162199020385742
the girls stared at their father.	8.665279388427734
"gracechurch-street, sept. 6.	23.97823143005371
the tête-à-tête surprised
them.	39.43263244628906
she really
looked almost wild."	30.64663314819336
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	64.56076049804688
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly."	35.97627639770508
_we_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."	44.991966247558594
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	40.93459701538086
you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."	35.51164627075195
but he is an ugly fellow!	37.50853729248047
it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	11.801362991333008
mrs bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth,

"miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	27.253225326538086
by you, i was properly humbled.	38.29035568237305
we passed each other
several times.	33.81380081176758
it would be dreadful!	19.81932258605957
it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	10.145214080810547
anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	18.106016159057617
"but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
next day."	8.267364501953125
[illustration: a vicarage house.]	31.076684951782227
a clergyman like you must marry.--chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.	38.79608917236328
"you write uncommonly fast."	38.62650680541992
lady
catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.	38.08464050292969
if you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.	30.273704528808594
"_you_ began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs bennet with civil
self-command to miss lucas.	43.248077392578125
"he is certainly a good brother," said elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	33.93247604370117
you must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."	18.489042282104492
the housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	32.22538757324219
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection."	39.94871139526367
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	51.07646942138672
mrs
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	51.403221130371094
but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	32.17852020263672
but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."	39.15671920776367
"and you saw him frequently?"	33.36054229736328
"by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; i wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer
     for being coherent.	22.56914710998535
i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	44.65768051147461
i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	72.54754638671875
but we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."	29.934579849243164
what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.	38.56098175048828
your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	46.0327033996582
at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."	24.168460845947266
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	23.741863250732422
"i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper i ever met with.	33.817848205566406
in her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	18.42799186706543
as for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin elizabeth."	26.73459243774414
miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present.	19.860376358032227
how does georgiana get on, darcy?"	22.909198760986328
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	47.58605194091797
"is that his design in settling here?"	28.39897346496582
the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"are you pleased with kent?"	26.522972106933594
by mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	33.26231384277344
"the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.	27.85318374633789
"oh!	37.51292419433594
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	31.30878257751465
kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton.	39.857662200927734
"we have heard only once.	21.300928115844727
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	36.69652557373047
"but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
opportunity."	50.90029525756836
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."	36.80341720581055
you have widely mistaken my
character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	31.987438201904297
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world i love, and he is an angel.	2.0139846801757812
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	35.9118766784668
this mrs
     younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	37.8245964050293
heaven forbid!	18.770389556884766
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.	24.864795684814453
"laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	17.67499351501465
did he know of
their intending to go off?	41.48117446899414
her answer was warmly in his favour.	28.092464447021484
in this danger kitty
is also comprehended.	21.217771530151367
"but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	6.745913028717041
and one of my
own daughters.	47.6489143371582
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	22.375179290771484
three daughters married!	18.30866813659668
he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in derbyshire.	21.541038513183594

she now lost every expectation of pleasure.	18.301599502563477
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.	23.912446975708008
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	55.54967498779297
you have a sweet room here, mr bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	25.113508224487305
"you are severe on us."	43.28167724609375
"there can be no doubt of that.	48.143943786621094
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	28.96209144592285
"she is so fond of mrs forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!	28.697908401489258
"she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.	41.699832916259766
after a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	63.03728103637695
when she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	7.693768501281738
"i do not believe a word of it, my dear.	20.55464744567871
"so much the better.	39.941993713378906
i _must_ have employment and society.	44.6856575012207
you
may have drawn him in."	57.85329818725586
to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	39.60798263549805
but jane was to go home with her, and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	23.65601348876953
and his
answering immediately to the last question--oh!	42.44301986694336
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	50.991477966308594

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	43.20596694946289
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	25.877710342407227
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."	38.70808410644531
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	188.5179901123047
had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	77.79546356201172
lady
catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	10.272448539733887
i was never more annoyed!	42.387142181396484
"does that young lady know mr darcy?"	24.950674057006836
his sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.	42.56088638305664
to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	27.888460159301758
her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	29.96240234375
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of mr darcy, she could not
but allow that mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	31.71065902709961
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to mr bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	58.22202682495117
and who knows what _may_ happen?	49.330997467041016
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	49.377872467041016
"certainly not; at first.	36.336483001708984
your's, very
     sincerely,

     "m.	62.40286636352539
he has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	49.261226654052734
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	39.58306884765625
"_you_ observed it, mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."	24.957414627075195
cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	25.79458999633789
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	45.351036071777344
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library."	17.39802360534668
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."	37.18836212158203
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	88.95677947998047
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	17.287986755371094
forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."	40.185001373291016
darcy mentioned his letter.	27.82828140258789
"la!	28.182266235351562
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	31.75943946838379
"good gracious!	33.31961441040039
the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year.	37.656341552734375
he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire.	6.066582202911377
she could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	33.81971740722656
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	45.180503845214844
she will follow wherever lydia leads.	37.596981048583984
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	41.37569808959961
"no--why should he?	43.171234130859375
they were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	12.379881858825684
no.--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."	49.9288330078125
"indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	26.163440704345703
"i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	41.28091812133789
but slyness seems the fashion.	26.522972106933594
"i advise mr darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs bennet, "to walk
to oakham mount this morning.	39.53739929199219
"excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant."	19.488162994384766
but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."	33.739864349365234
"oh!	47.873390197753906
you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	35.89896774291992
towards _him_ i have been
kinder than towards myself."	41.43281555175781
"that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."	22.61467742919922
"and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently.	40.38005447387695
and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,

"indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	34.894187927246094
he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	26.846609115600586
*       *       *       *       *

"good gracious!"	31.220748901367188
she was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	27.189538955688477
amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	27.68196678161621
"my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.	25.849905014038086
their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially,
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	21.393321990966797
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.	41.006805419921875
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist
mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.	32.84282684326172
two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, mrs bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	54.89999008178711
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."	26.997102737426758
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	21.152917861938477
"i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	47.453182220458984
but we are all liable to
error.	8.119827270507812
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	31.69923210144043
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	27.715177536010742
no one but mrs bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.	52.958805084228516
other schemes too came into her head.	46.802738189697266
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	24.374374389648438
"we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine and
lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.	23.303466796875
"a gamester!"	21.881011962890625
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which
i have not already heard.	26.409940719604492
you must not disappoint your father."	43.119476318359375
were questions with which she amused herself.	27.79279136657715
your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	27.481689453125
i cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family."	36.79328918457031
wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."	38.55803298950195
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	48.63636016845703
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."	19.112163543701172
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time.	14.818690299987793
it is really too distressing.	33.11286926269531
but tell me, what did you come down to
netherfield for?	35.8858642578125
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	4.754086971282959
sir william had been
delighted with him.	25.320262908935547
"i have just had a letter from
jane, with such dreadful news.	11.686365127563477
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm
license terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	59.283084869384766
see paragraph 1.e below.	71.89604949951172
_i_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	30.2614803314209
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring?"	32.16553497314453
he
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	34.91107940673828
how i long to see her!	45.024105072021484
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time.	25.36269760131836
"i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."	37.94157028198242
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.	19.69347381591797
a young man, such
as you describe mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	39.49755859375
but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	32.62396240234375
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	10.475022315979004
my poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room.	49.406455993652344
_my_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property.	21.476896286010742
i am sure you must feel it
so."	25.63758087158203
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."	30.350854873657227
what a good joke it will be!	12.125937461853027
"mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself?"	29.939672470092773
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	14.698644638061523
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	32.48799514770508
stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."	51.253578186035156
allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	23.026220321655273
having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	60.9293212890625
you dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."	48.36019515991211
"nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	33.67367935180664
have you seen any pleasant men?	34.60264205932617
it was an
encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
very strenuously have opposed it.	64.02997589111328
"do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	78.72000122070312
"if i," said mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	34.34269332885742
that his two sisters and mr darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	25.90104103088379
but, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."	29.72412872314453
"not the slightest.	17.167667388916016
and you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."	34.80303955078125
they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically anything with public domain ebooks.	23.988821029663086
i know your
disposition, lizzy.	51.380088806152344
"if he wants our society, let
him seek it.	20.33637046813965
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr bennet
came from it.	51.50812530517578
during their walk, it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	40.119659423828125
she did indeed.	35.3332633972168
no principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy.	61.61773681640625
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.	14.443217277526855
"i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	57.192893981933594
but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."	49.45338439941406
i was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	26.5025634765625
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor."	18.454988479614258
"a man who had felt less, might."	39.370323181152344
the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you.	20.855920791625977
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	27.458667755126953
my sisters may write to _me_.	51.64225387573242
mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	31.501724243164062
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	35.676544189453125
said jane.	36.53342819213867
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	34.96464920043945
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.	15.581269264221191
i knew it myself, as
     it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--it is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer.	29.290119171142578
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	40.53023147583008
"yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."	55.944156646728516
their table was superlatively stupid.	30.96561050415039
happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!"	39.08910369873047
you know pretty well, i suppose,
     what has been done for the young people.	41.5865478515625
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	36.14936447143555
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	26.051773071289062
"yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."	42.86984634399414
as yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.	18.08230972290039
"i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said darcy.	63.50415802001953
she had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	41.892425537109375
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	48.87046813964844
poor
jane!	31.894887924194336
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	20.470367431640625
when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	32.68368911743164
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	35.585052490234375
the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country.	42.25185775756836
the strangeness of mr collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	58.512062072753906
"mr darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	43.84956359863281
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs
hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	25.412017822265625
i am not equal to it.	35.15180587768555
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	16.794166564941406
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	51.7586784362793
the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.	52.24625015258789
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage.	83.39189147949219
did she call to refuse her consent?"	20.527978897094727
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give.	115.9371109008789
i shall see her in january.	60.80547332763672
"you never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	57.387943267822266
you have employed your
time much better.	73.28118133544922
no, never.	22.976272583007812
i hope you have destroyed the letter.	29.847681045532227
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	33.84706497192383
"my uncle is to send a servant for us."	36.723236083984375
"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	24.81927490234375
"she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	32.74492263793945
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."	44.74483871459961
it was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	45.98551940917969
the promised
letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	17.31878662109375
"as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	27.864580154418945
you take
delight in vexing me.	24.353958129882812
society, i own, is necessary to me.	54.901641845703125
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"	70.95787811279297
"oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice.	26.22809410095215
put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	49.91061782836914
"i think you said she was a widow, sir?	30.4019775390625
the
rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	24.027202606201172
when i went away, i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again!	36.217620849609375
they soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	33.405601501464844
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's
way."	28.42432975769043
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."	23.927953720092773
they had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	24.82333755493164
i do not know who is
good enough for him."	25.97958755493164
his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	37.566627502441406
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham."	34.653690338134766
having said thus much, i feel no
     doubt of your secrecy.	46.8530158996582
but if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	33.86968231201172
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
by herself.	69.46495056152344
jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	52.30824661254883
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which mr darcy afterwards discharged.	49.2453727722168
"you have a house in town, i conclude?"	13.54206371307373
they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	26.522972106933594
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.	40.54840850830078
"no, indeed, i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's
connections.	37.77549743652344
she had obtained private intelligence that mr
darcy did not wish for cards; and mr hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	34.28478240966797
"oh!	51.99143981933594
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	46.24977111816406
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	44.82841110229492
her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	54.24649429321289
"yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	38.00345230102539
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
with mrs hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
london.	22.75265121459961
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	22.208051681518555
on this subject, what can you have to
say?	24.079111099243164
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"in vain have i struggled.	36.689998626708984
he
is so excessively handsome!	35.64530563354492
all
elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	23.566009521484375
dear me!	16.780506134033203
i cannot
     understand it.	31.20574188232422
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it."	58.47385025024414
i am going to-morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	30.595754623413086
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	18.671504974365234
"she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley.	47.696163177490234
it cannot last long.	24.732492446899414
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."	29.653907775878906
risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."	26.550647735595703
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr bennet, "and
nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.	82.1827621459961
you refuse, then, to oblige me.	47.28318405151367
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	14.744894981384277
mr darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	42.817108154296875
but it was not to be.	49.71886444091797
"for the liveliness of your mind, i did."	49.27316665649414
but these things happen so often!	33.2896614074707
my dear, dear jane, i am so
happy!	18.020427703857422
when mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	25.73285484313965
his affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.	29.055383682250977
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	33.68522644042969
i know no harm of her."	33.51548767089844
"this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	72.6953125
i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together."	28.741771697998047
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be
placed in the gallery at pemberley.	27.195228576660156
let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay.	46.89213943481445
of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	83.35614776611328
mr bingley arrived.	39.967987060546875
my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	81.05730438232422
as a
child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
temper.	39.36508560180664
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	35.743309020996094
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	25.208839416503906
i have
not the smallest hope.	43.558860778808594
"to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."	37.47181701660156
but
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy mr collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's
praise into his own hands.	24.530956268310547
"if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."	23.193071365356445
this preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	58.76536560058594
a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern.	34.63070297241211
i am
afraid you will be angry."	53.22543716430664
"i am glad i bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	32.990501403808594
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	37.60359191894531
she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	24.009071350097656
"there
is nothing the matter with me.	16.106224060058594
his character is thereby complete."	12.110953330993652
"i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."	23.19487953186035
"that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever
heard you utter.	12.003350257873535
you know my sentiments."	42.9637451171875
it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	36.46963882446289
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	29.218355178833008
mary and kitty, thank
heaven!	35.99846267700195
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.	30.302959442138672
but now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	49.249664306640625
my uncle!"	28.804243087768555
you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	49.404266357421875
while
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	36.28805160522461
they went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	21.395496368408203
"it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	46.3717155456543
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr
wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	53.57367706298828
about a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate;
     and thither also went mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs
     younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	104.66521453857422
they are gone off together
from brighton.	51.82175064086914
"what is his name?"	34.32449722290039
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	30.58592987060547
he had to be sure done much.	14.880208015441895
but, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane.	33.129486083984375
mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	5.747265815734863
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	25.348634719848633
"what do you mean?"	39.96708679199219
"i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."	31.399354934692383
ten thousand a year!	18.78839111328125
mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	34.25639724731445
wherever you and jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly
sisters.	18.80915641784668
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."	30.833293914794922
a report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	32.73859405517578
they are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	23.107900619506836
i hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point."	12.475351333618164
neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach."	16.598262786865234
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
mr collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure."	9.996298789978027
eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	39.80610275268555
let her go then.	30.81329917907715
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!	32.11561584472656
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!	13.921223640441895
you deserve no such attention.	34.84125900268555
"it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began.	37.111385345458984
have a little
compassion on my nerves.	35.496761322021484
bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence.	77.91384887695312
"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said elizabeth.	17.92786407470703
i know it to be impossible."	23.387481689453125
after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	31.424198150634766
she finds miss pope a treasure.	26.096233367919922
his doing so
drew her notice.	32.518707275390625
"i confess," said he, "that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings.	9.550745964050293
this information, however, startled mrs bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.	51.257869720458984
they gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	45.476036071777344
"but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return."	26.92979621887207
there is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, i dare say."	36.05515670776367
"no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton."	51.26987075805664
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	67.12623596191406
jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	15.5269775390625
"you are quite a visit in my debt, mr bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	36.026432037353516
her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr darcy then
was.	52.09822463989258
she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	18.045042037963867
_her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	37.518775939941406
cried mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley!	44.02614212036133
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	20.64599609375
do not let us
quarrel about the past.	32.84983444213867
people _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
it is not true.	43.09549331665039
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and
lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	22.76737403869629
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	30.321758270263672
"there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?"	19.05864906311035
they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs
bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	42.108299255371094
if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better.	6.4066362380981445
both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	105.46444702148438
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr
darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	27.19115447998047
the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.	32.41227340698242
jane shook her head.	29.71346664428711
1.f.1.	27.91448974609375
can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"	31.194923400878906
if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy!	34.96078872680664
but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	47.839969635009766
cried elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.	30.169601440429688
mr collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	29.179773330688477
in every view it
is unaccountable!"	36.58131790161133
mr
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	31.59492301940918
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_."	33.3349494934082
i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	40.14706039428711
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george
wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the
late mr darcy's steward.	15.262822151184082
she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	27.636255264282227
he was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	47.14263153076172
"i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	6.775151252746582
said elizabeth.	33.77435302734375
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	27.58805274963379
they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	38.963741302490234
1.e.8.	30.229501724243164
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy.	142.80609130859375
with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	14.052114486694336
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.	25.093246459960938
elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	27.247737884521484
"no.	5.728726863861084
i do not believe she often sees such at home."	60.301246643066406
her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	5.934024810791016
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	75.33419799804688
"to-morrow fortnight."	40.36197280883789
"yes, very different.	42.32244873046875
my fingers wait your orders."	31.91621971130371
"she is a very fine-looking woman!	30.04652214050293
they saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	39.84654235839844
despite these efforts, project gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.	44.018585205078125
but i
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london.	55.51715850830078
i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, i should not pay him half so much deference.	34.36377716064453
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	54.260597229003906
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	33.05170440673828
"i will not be interrupted.	51.463233947753906
to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	43.26294708251953
"i am," said he, with a firm voice.	56.16317367553711
now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?	32.8922233581543
i should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	34.36262130737305
said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	26.439773559570312
mr darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	27.382844924926758
she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	30.519372940063477
"no, nothing at all."	27.414541244506836
he is gone to my father already.	56.2362174987793
"of music!	32.25141906738281
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!	35.17533874511719
mrs bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	49.802669525146484
you may imagine what i felt
     and how i acted.	27.36507225036621
but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	31.318758010864258
"lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room."	20.914588928222656
"you are over scrupulous surely.	41.305728912353516
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	35.275146484375
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you
joy?"	28.137290954589844
if you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday
     se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as
     lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day.	27.616483688354492
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr wickham.	45.52412033081055
but
nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done.	35.15846633911133
redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.	38.11152267456055
i need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	21.489805221557617
he will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."	82.346923828125
how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?	34.19165802001953
"what could he mean?	26.429136276245117
in three volumes.	33.35329055786133
"well, so much the better.	15.262822151184082
if i
had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
him.	38.33174514770508
but the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."	38.56304168701172
he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	55.82283401489258
said elizabeth.	33.00837326049805
and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is
the usual price of an earl's younger son?	22.010778427124023
"well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	84.29960632324219
"i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring.	49.630943298339844
"what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	14.089573860168457
for god's sake, say no more of
his partners.	37.25991439819336
i must conclude, for i cannot be
     long from my poor mother.	60.08285903930664
mamma, do the
people here abouts know i am married to-day?	29.394275665283203
"upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	28.617015838623047
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	25.774171829223633
"complied with!	57.51694869995117
this was agreed to, and mrs philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	48.53505325317383
you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	58.566856384277344
and, above all things, keep mr bennet from
fighting.	104.88599395751953
how are they even to be discovered?	30.39447593688965
it distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
parsonage.	42.591636657714844
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	20.537330627441406
all loveliness and goodness as she is!	33.9424934387207
i had not an idea of it."	54.8141975402832
in that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	21.94356346130371
_i_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	40.818660736083984
mrs bennet, we shall have her
at netherfield at last.'	35.34516143798828
how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!	24.964263916015625
and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	39.37390899658203
"mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	68.48243713378906
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"	27.30788230895996
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.	20.71987533569336
from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr
collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed.	47.327392578125
i
am sure my sisters must all envy me.	74.0360107421875
"in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	26.522972106933594
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	30.636829376220703
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.	38.33266067504883
but she is nothing to me now.	29.840105056762695
"oh!	80.1678695678711
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	42.61482620239258
but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"	88.4578628540039
he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	23.322111129760742
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	30.577945709228516
a few days after this visit, mr bingley called again, and alone.	77.28694915771484
do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.	29.168556213378906
the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.	43.90373229980469
it was dated
from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.	33.33688735961914
perhaps he thought her too young.	43.440155029296875
mr darcy danced
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	46.55867004394531
"he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"	32.787628173828125
there is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town.	21.94889259338379
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness.	29.27865982055664
you and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, mr bingley might like you the best of the
party."	29.684385299682617
in the former were many good paintings;
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	24.657703399658203
a great deal more passed at the
other table.	94.9219741821289
after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.	42.38680648803711
she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	31.91109848022461
he now wished it more than ever.	43.95527267456055
elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	23.540983200073242
but
these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	37.836639404296875
now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	23.66412353515625
she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	31.983562469482422
i will speak to her about it myself directly.	28.563289642333984
"i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.	33.71358108520508
elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.	46.78517532348633
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	55.22724914550781
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.	30.401033401489258
as a clergyman, moreover, i
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	31.00857925415039
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	35.55694580078125
the compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	52.575923919677734
"the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting.	27.33396339416504
"now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy.	26.522972106933594
your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	49.33456039428711
your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	38.94630813598633
a flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	26.60163688659668
"oh!	29.19008445739746
mrs collins knew not what to make of him.	41.065460205078125
"what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!"	29.06505584716797
"yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	26.859174728393555
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	30.83936882019043
it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham.	47.598976135253906
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
at all."	32.73416519165039
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"	11.028474807739258
but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will
take it on myself."	45.40057373046875
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy,
"of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.	24.391271591186523
"go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	35.777103424072266
but that is one great difference between
us.	63.74273681640625
elizabeth was delighted.	170.0437774658203
he merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."	12.50509262084961
"if one could but go to brighton!"	54.15997314453125
but are you pleased,
jane?	29.931400299072266
it was really a very
handsome thought.	43.563636779785156
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	33.73971176147461
pray forgive
     me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
     have been all round the park.	42.588043212890625
my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."	39.82221221923828
it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	34.07876205444336
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three
weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	31.500831604003906
it was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	23.13413429260254
elizabeth
was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	42.48114776611328
"well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	55.051090240478516
"heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me
such an evil."	32.895050048828125
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	38.3546257019043
i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say.	43.74971389770508
the sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	34.098243713378906
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	28.572805404663086
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed.	25.467798233032227
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her.	105.00630187988281
"this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune!	25.61362648010254
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not
return it.	47.747657775878906
she longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to
jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.	20.506168365478516
"no, indeed.	27.20558738708496
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful."	35.09788131713867
"indeed, mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	57.99477005004883
his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
mr darcy with a very expressive smile.	43.406982421875
"are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"	26.962440490722656
"you are then resolved to have him?"	28.31559944152832
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	39.52676010131836
she felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.	38.31804656982422
they look upon it
quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens."	41.09379196166992
"can i have the carriage?"	105.46444702148438
he promises fairly, and i hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent.	47.79764175415039
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	28.370328903198242
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	27.596092224121094
1.b.	32.016658782958984
she could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	42.313316345214844
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c. are
sufficiently known.	34.172767639160156
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	26.74769401550293
he shall not be in love with me, if i
can prevent it."	35.26085662841797
elizabeth replied that it was.	28.01315689086914
"not that i _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."	39.12766647338867
"what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr
darcy had much better finish his letter."	54.94121170043945
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	56.10655975341797
she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	42.441341400146484
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
not rest till i knew the particulars.	28.795270919799805
"believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	57.933876037597656
it was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	26.522972106933594
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states.	37.49704360961914
"all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."	30.999353408813477
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	32.364627838134766
"oh!	34.95816421508789
she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."	63.386024475097656
this son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	87.56305694580078
it exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.	41.942134857177734
"is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare
that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means most kindly!	42.2940559387207
"can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	45.47948455810547
sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	44.06545639038086
but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton;
and the hursts have no horses to theirs."	27.993152618408203
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet, and
mrs hurst was observing their game.	39.69973373413086
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	26.207298278808594
"and that," said mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.	22.93562889099121
not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.	21.817224502563477
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure
you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do.	29.805057525634766
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	19.484771728515625
brother-in-law of wickham!	16.698545455932617
he took the hint,
and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"that will do extremely well, child.	25.292648315429688
she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	43.945613861083984
mrs bennet was not in the
habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	40.673221588134766
i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly.	38.202171325683594
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
think it is well expressed."	40.51592254638672
"and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?"	23.3284854888916
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.	26.726308822631836
this was one point, with
regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	25.501239776611328
he was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_
a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.'	16.48794937133789
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too!	18.282983779907227
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	42.29065704345703
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson; did not
i mention it to you?	42.58140563964844
he could even
listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st. james's, with very decent composure.	20.179805755615234
how i laughed!	34.106048583984375
thought she.	87.86318969726562
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr darcy.	28.70726776123047
"how strange!"	40.764381408691406
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a
lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr darcy, drawing near
elizabeth, said to her--

"do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"	31.698076248168945
his consenting to marry
her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	45.59531784057617
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	30.358762741088867
she seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.	44.94997024536133
his temptation is
not adequate to the risk."	69.81651306152344
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	36.47933578491211
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.	36.28619384765625
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	35.434364318847656
but vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	18.89414405822754
i shall go distracted."	24.334611892700195
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	36.658138275146484
give my love to colonel forster, i hope you
     will drink to our good journey.	10.711468696594238
he was very fond of them."	46.2359619140625
he
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	13.130093574523926
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.	17.40437889099121
cried elizabeth.	22.735130310058594
if i have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured mr wickham, i can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family.	29.44057846069336
when a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."	35.7535285949707
no look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	32.079017639160156
"yes, indeed," cried mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	30.258485794067383
mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs bennet.	18.54878807067871
elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	39.02408981323242
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr
hurst had a house.	45.050350189208984
but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem.	29.18495750427246
at night she opened her heart to jane.	42.12459945678711
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	25.055984497070312
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"jane, i congratulate you.	30.862985610961914
but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	28.34429931640625
contact the
foundation as set forth in section 3 below.	35.19441223144531
"nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	20.376100540161133
"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."	35.195796966552734
he
then said,

"i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.	36.69300842285156
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	44.40211486816406

"why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."	31.956186294555664
mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	44.93903732299805
"i see no occasion for that.	39.59872817993164
this letter is from mr collins."	45.2437744140625
"i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	50.63618850708008
"my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?"	31.840639114379883
"it must have been his sister's doing.	34.96915054321289
with a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	72.74423217773438
it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	45.18736267089844
she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	84.3265380859375
her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	32.72945022583008
"well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?	67.82674407958984
her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.	30.552024841308594
"you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	16.57364273071289
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"let me call your maid.	39.06772232055664
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	71.18062591552734
"i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	845.4315185546875

the letter was to this
effect:

     "my dear lizzy,

     "i wish you joy.	26.522972106933594
the lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	26.560626983642578
"if!	21.538341522216797
"miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	22.803613662719727
"oh!	45.18106460571289
however, i
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for mr darcy might have done as well."	28.995046615600586
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	12.929680824279785
from
what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	22.71283531188965
"what do you mean, hill?	33.63086700439453
mr darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life!	44.43579864501953
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
saw any thing of it.	26.325511932373047
he has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."	20.508255004882812
an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.	31.558650970458984
yet, indeed, i am
in earnest.	19.723024368286133
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.	45.85197830200195
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	35.5092658996582
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	39.326107025146484
but georgiana would not join
her.	50.9061164855957
his surprise was great.	19.06336212158203
"i have heard much of your master's fine person," said mrs gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	29.2944393157959
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"did not you think, mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?"	19.342723846435547
for the last week they had seen very little
of either lady catherine or her daughter.	78.9687271118164
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	47.33734893798828
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st. james's.	42.22261047363281
and it was not wholly without foundation.	50.126190185546875
the day passed much as the day before had done.	39.028804779052734
and so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	29.26640510559082
no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	5.496817588806152
at present i am not in love with
mr wickham; no, i certainly am not.	35.880191802978516
mr wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed.	56.76724624633789
i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	27.11382484436035
cried lydia.	45.52730941772461
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	35.77607345581055
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.	48.77088165283203
"oh, lord!	37.020423889160156
and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	16.119958877563477
thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."	60.211952209472656
the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	27.48478889465332
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.	10.273067474365234
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.	29.956872940063477
they were, therefore, to go.--elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	71.10592651367188
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	28.44858169555664
"books--oh!	47.650142669677734
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	57.10114669799805
"what will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are!	26.730735778808594
additional terms will be linked
to the project gutenberg-tm license for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.	63.21376419067383
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	8.835647583007812
there was no arguing upon such a project.	58.059871673583984
she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	44.80250930786133
and so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?	30.494840621948242
wickham only shook his head.	19.85817527770996
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	42.028621673583984
every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	28.584033966064453
we have not met since the 26th of november, when
we were all dancing together at netherfield."	26.161300659179688
i do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	20.039857864379883
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	43.014892578125
the prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	21.534061431884766
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	57.880088806152344
i was uncomfortable enough.	15.815132141113281
i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	22.42940902709961
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself."	32.60793685913086
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.	44.51552963256836
every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.	25.50310516357422
"care of him!--yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care.	29.04702377319336
she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	37.95524215698242
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	25.66267967224121
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	23.761817932128906
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	28.764009475708008
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	69.42729949951172
and i think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.	38.53950500488281
i had not
believed it possible."	32.70514678955078
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland.	46.21331024169922
she had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	39.49068832397461
"a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	9.947037696838379
"have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?	20.654001235961914
"that is right.--you could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.	41.3084716796875
the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	89.08386993408203
with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted!	29.883121490478516
"blame you!	21.881128311157227
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	203.6749725341797
_i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	28.858701705932617
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at brighton.	28.5322322845459
"perfectly so--i thank you."	20.185352325439453
well!	10.828264236450195
this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	40.7214469909668
their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	22.050891876220703
till this moment, i never knew myself."	23.98194122314453

but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	23.920921325683594
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	43.77508544921875
the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	16.82421875
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir
william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.	32.02857208251953
far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	31.690650939941406
her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	19.60745620727539
younger sons cannot marry
where they like."	27.841869354248047
the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.	29.60066795349121
one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.	36.947105407714844
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	32.89381790161133
"oh, yes.	29.094091415405273
my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	34.5988655090332
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	25.55591583251953
lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention.	84.31214904785156
miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	37.42135238647461
she liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	35.96370315551758
miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	15.107590675354004
my sweetest lizzy!	31.027238845825195
but, on second thoughts,
perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."	32.044654846191406
lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard,
and if he does, colonel forster will hire him.	38.076515197753906
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."	23.136049270629883
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr collins
very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	24.142871856689453
he is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.	46.4039421081543
but there
are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am
ever to pay him."	57.98575210571289
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	49.66583251953125
his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative.	33.39476013183594
it is every way horrible!"	66.06587982177734
"it is no such thing.	67.53748321533203
one came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	43.32896041870117
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	29.071460723876953
she had a sister married to a mr philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade.	24.410188674926758
but i have
other provocations.	108.09037017822266
he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you
cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	28.61492156982422
during dinner, mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	25.36693572998047
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	64.6201400756836
"why will you think so?	35.70595169067383
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	15.840118408203125

it was all
     over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been.	44.22389221191406
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	23.1269588470459
cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted.	24.900375366210938
there can be no love in all this.	26.74164390563965
had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	39.36880111694336
i am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	25.186607360839844
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	26.476598739624023
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	40.097843170166016
what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received!	48.90579605102539
sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine."	28.29976463317871
"you either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire."	12.126559257507324
"_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.	22.16347312927246
his regiment is there; for i suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	24.496803283691406
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	45.29049301147461
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	36.90286636352539
mr
     darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	34.13436508178711
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	58.5477294921875
i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	35.28952407836914
he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure
_i_ never want to see him again.	41.16968536376953
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."	37.019309997558594
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	32.1243896484375
"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	57.46946716308594
in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	29.498245239257812
with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"	46.53230285644531
his revenge would have been complete indeed.	27.514909744262695
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.	140.5565643310547
they battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved.	28.707672119140625
i was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr darcy.	39.294403076171875
"yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	31.590572357177734
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking.	34.27113342285156
in the absence of jane,
he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	25.185617446899414
it is highly improper.	30.176692962646484
at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs hurst and
elizabeth herself.	50.56346130371094
vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	21.917695999145508
why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	38.368709564208984
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	23.47421646118164
i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention;
the other is charlotte's marriage.	30.624452590942383
mr collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	39.28942108154297
mr darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	21.340389251708984
after this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	32.43809127807617
mr collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	25.57537269592285
mr collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	41.32500457763672
my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	43.88981246948242
i know you will contrive it all."	18.159442901611328
never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her.	67.58158874511719
but before they heard again from mr gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from mr collins; which, as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	33.50933837890625
nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	29.534006118774414
a person may be
proud without being vain.	22.488733291625977
mr collins!"	31.332456588745117
"that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	26.9603271484375
i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	25.391345977783203
human nature is so prone to
fall into it!	35.285648345947266
"to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	81.58047485351562
he has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."	40.55705261230469
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."	13.19176959991455
presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	30.108596801757812
the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	31.57419204711914
much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going
to be married.	40.68975067138672
i _will_ leave him to himself."	26.507164001464844
that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.	33.56317138671875
you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."	37.78078842163086
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	49.76716995239258
"yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	19.343618392944336
_that_ abominable mr darcy!--my father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.	9.952679634094238
the whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	35.39302062988281
"no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	53.331424713134766
it will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."	74.60586547851562
how could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"	37.800987243652344
they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr
bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.	48.4755744934082
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is
impossible.	45.235591888427734
"did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	21.157794952392578
multiple
      superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets
      example: m^{rs}.	39.96195602416992
she enquired into charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	56.38315200805664
"good heaven!	46.14548873901367
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	24.33298110961914
mrs
bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger!	28.756559371948242
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	11.674299240112305
she is
not such a simpleton.	58.410396575927734
"and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters."	31.69454002380371
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	25.12360954284668
his air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	18.123641967773438
this cannot be!	43.550533294677734
pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.	58.771358489990234
in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to mr darcy were by no means over.	42.79755401611328
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	30.621301651000977
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	21.819929122924805
"i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have
not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	393.8902587890625
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"	38.14379119873047
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	22.609718322753906
lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr
collins first came to hunsford."	36.102603912353516
"how so?	35.73308563232422
i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	29.13005256652832
five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing.	32.14692687988281
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	24.171550750732422
they were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities.	15.576976776123047
if _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	14.813497543334961

you shall hear what she says."	52.93657302856445
your idea of the ponies is delightful.	36.18501281738281
there was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	17.733970642089844
i have faults enough,
but they are not, i hope, of understanding.	46.05420684814453
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame.	36.00193786621094
he takes them now for people of
fashion."	52.996986389160156
"i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london.	26.045705795288086
she remembered also, that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr
darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	34.586769104003906
you must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say.	41.47722244262695
"i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."	49.475807189941406
i am very glad
you liked her.	34.90005874633789
mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	25.447479248046875
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	31.0397891998291
his sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	36.405174255371094
one must speak a little, you know.	51.50053787231445
"_that_ is a failing indeed!"	28.287904739379883
nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	55.56793212890625
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	50.40547180175781
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	26.965063095092773
i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	32.586307525634766
"he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	24.59697914123535
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.	42.39760971069336
it became her turn to listen.	20.70096206665039
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	36.8398551940918
your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."	33.64847183227539
that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	28.28247833251953
elizabeth felt jane's
pleasure.	29.278297424316406
but perhaps mr bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."	17.781309127807617
let me hear
     from you very soon.	32.57523727416992
miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	35.357215881347656
my kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till i am better.	111.80963897705078
i must confess myself
     surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.	19.772706985473633
though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was
her, i would not have put up with it.	26.686969757080078
they came.	30.045654296875
thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
assure you there are many amiable young women.	33.23735046386719
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	62.09333801269531
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	33.736392974853516
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	35.65031814575195
mr darcy!--and so it does i vow.	55.36992645263672
she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	10.519372940063477
what do i not
owe you!	31.215621948242188
"hate you!	17.31667137145996
how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!	70.78880310058594
elizabeth, equally
next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	33.23650360107422
special rules,
set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark.	105.46444702148438
he has heartily forgiven me
now."	40.2885627746582
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.	66.12351989746094
1.e.4.	46.195518493652344
as a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him!	42.56919479370117
"this is an evening of wonders, indeed!	24.69140625
"how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!	81.88402557373047
and then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.	23.099958419799805
but that is not the
case _here_.	27.83336067199707
he is come--mr bingley is
come.--he is, indeed.	32.641292572021484
"did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	37.76435852050781
my aunt told me so
herself on saturday.	20.383825302124023
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	27.33536720275879
"but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."	42.5281982421875
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him."	20.187599182128906
mrs bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
mr bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	34.692874908447266
darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
consented.	30.48617172241211
the fee is
     owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     project gutenberg literary archive foundation.	47.597389221191406
it is impossible that he should still love
me."	35.263999938964844
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."	4.142248630523682
the distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	69.05101776123047
"i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.	20.853784561157227
poor dear
child!	40.57419967651367
no thanks to his gallantry for that.	46.2191276550293
four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	27.340057373046875
mrs gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	22.16913414001465
"certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	8.348906517028809
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
we shall do."	30.04050636291504
"a man who has once been refused!	17.322370529174805
you may depend upon my seeking no further."	32.82432556152344
that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	11.707233428955078
the foundation's principal office is located at 4557 melan dr. s.
fairbanks, ak, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.	24.84588623046875
the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	20.249345779418945
by nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at st. james's had made him
courteous.	21.362781524658203
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	30.59587860107422
there are a few
things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	38.46076583862305
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	22.375946044921875
my sister, i am
sure, will not hear of her removal."	36.33325958251953
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister!	66.43086242675781
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.	33.8802375793457
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.	23.950468063354492
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	32.58180236816406
and
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	15.914224624633789
said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with."	29.011953353881836
but jane and elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	43.602500915527344
"our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."	56.49429702758789
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.	35.652217864990234
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard."	35.234291076660156
if you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	23.982696533203125
"my dear sir," replied mr collins, "i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	49.019378662109375
wont it, kitty?"	33.14097595214844
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from caroline.	25.047420501708984
"oh, yes!--he was to come there with wickham, you know.	35.26763153076172
your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--if it be so, if i have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.	66.84247589111328
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	14.164015769958496
kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; by the bye, mrs forster and me are _such_ friends!	12.894991874694824
"i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a
kingdom!	13.636529922485352
cried miss bingley.	25.13569450378418
ring the bell,
kitty, for hill.	12.386173248291016
but you are always giving _her_ the
preference."	37.37820816040039
"yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	34.30359649658203
"already arisen!"	11.478671073913574
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	29.390592575073242
they had frequently been staying with her in town.	36.511512756347656
does he
know his real character?"	23.359500885009766
"yes--if darcy does not put it off again.	39.42940902709961
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as i certainly did."	63.245208740234375
her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	16.641843795776367
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	48.02623748779297
is not it so, mrs bennet?"	68.86392211914062
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"	47.257747650146484
she had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.	41.82662582397461
what news?	14.325698852539062
only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	44.8409423828125
"as soon as ever mr bingley comes, my dear," said mrs bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."	13.785426139831543
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- you pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of project gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.	40.40479278564453
every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.	42.86909866333008
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king.	20.703222274780273
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.	60.785240173339844
"i have, sir."	23.401988983154297
"i am sure i shall break _mine_," said lydia.	56.95470428466797
and with no one to speak to, of what i
felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had!	20.71527671813965
what
could be more natural than his asking you again?	48.188758850097656
these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	23.738718032836914
"pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."	31.043888092041016
she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	24.460140228271484
he had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	52.71165466308594
"your affectionate friend,

     "lydia bennet."	41.1331672668457
mrs wickham!	25.7819766998291
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	16.015432357788086
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without
calling her attention.	28.867246627807617
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	38.31806564331055
take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.	30.05668830871582
they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."	56.04644012451172
"you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.	28.199861526489258
you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	42.386966705322266
"i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.	27.84306526184082
her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	20.53537368774414
he who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	33.83564758300781
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	24.978416442871094
and this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace.	83.47666931152344
i think i have heard you say that you know them."	27.530723571777344
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for jane.	76.76617431640625
so much the better.	48.0304069519043
and what can _he_ have to say?"	21.489805221557617
that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	21.899511337280273
i have no such injuries to resent.	149.18350219726562
in three volumes.	40.61793899536133
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."	27.64042091369629
i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!	32.796791076660156
miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr darcy looked
up.	37.09568405151367
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	32.48200225830078
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	60.602474212646484
"indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	42.094730377197266
"my dear mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	27.972759246826172
"aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had
known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	23.17474937438965
and do you
really love him quite well enough?	24.684358596801758
mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	46.38218688964844
and so extremely
accomplished for her age!	21.253629684448242
"yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside."	27.992284774780273
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins,
and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy."	16.194196701049805
elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.	37.538726806640625
mr collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	32.788665771484375
i
hope he will overlook it.	26.843162536621094
the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	28.94306755065918
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	45.11170196533203
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
together.	23.61240005493164
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers."	30.30389976501465
if there _were_ but
such another man for you!"	23.254566192626953
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once.	13.684144973754883
"aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."	43.95406723022461
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	19.175708770751953
--a
short pause followed this speech, and mrs hurst began again.	34.18645095825195
she resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	21.755542755126953
how shall i bear so much happiness!"	39.94207000732422
i
shall now know how to act.	43.018943786621094
her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.	16.863061904907227
elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.	15.63439655303955
"had you then persuaded yourself that i should?"	37.88064193725586
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	42.69035339355469
"and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."	20.93354606628418
you will be a very happy woman."	28.799549102783203
but against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	22.856060028076172
"is it possible!"	26.76225471496582
he was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	31.55797576904297
how could i
     be so silly as to wish it!	47.31501770019531
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.	40.31459045410156
"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr darcy!--there
is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."	39.47782516479492
charlotte the wife of mr collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	32.776336669921875
"it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	89.292724609375
it was a rational scheme to be sure!	37.772438049316406
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	1.8288949728012085
i quite detest the man."	17.833240509033203
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance.	49.78682327270508
oh!	71.9802017211914
this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."	18.816041946411133
mr bennet could not have chosen
better.	18.64099884033203
my dear jane, i am in
such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you
write for me.	35.83753967285156
"yes; he introduced us to his sister."	33.81423568725586
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	31.337759017944336
"i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful."	29.388158798217773
i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."	34.92002487182617
the period of expectation was now doubled.	20.120487213134766
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	5.139858245849609
lady catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr
darcy.	29.30878448486328

you
mentioned _two_ instances.	24.220077514648438
and if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	38.26801681518555
"john told us mr darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	55.18597412109375
but no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	22.547462463378906
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	74.62998962402344
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	37.24491882324219
but i must tell you how it went off.	49.07353210449219
i wish you had been there.	28.721389770507812
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	24.470802307128906
she turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	15.781639099121094
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	35.25798034667969
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	26.797840118408203
"certainly not."	29.532255172729492
elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	38.677642822265625
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady
catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	33.340824127197266
"no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.	54.87229919433594
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	30.728532791137695
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,"
said he.	42.90734100341797
her own thoughts were employing her.	37.25724792480469
it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	22.506860733032227
"project gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	44.68595504760742
now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

"mr darcy, i am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding your's.	33.030006408691406
let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	33.65580368041992
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me.	46.97743225097656
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear.	31.258163452148438
as to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.	109.31179809570312
she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	87.43914031982422
"i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley's conduct to design,"
said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	18.490018844604492
"certainly.	30.713531494140625
1813.	30.249370574951172
what is it you are talking
of?	43.60960006713867
recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	22.139915466308594
i have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, i should think you could not do better.	105.46444702148438
"to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding, than i now do of her heart.	13.412761688232422
my dear brother," replied mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i
could most wish for.	20.91209602355957
i am not qualified to form one.	27.848587036132812
1.f.5.	52.772151947021484
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter.	41.73267364501953
it is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."	7.879072189331055
my dear, dear
lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!"	23.45784568786621
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did.	19.663503646850586
"mrs annesley is with her.	48.186981201171875
a thousand things may arise in six months!"	29.373680114746094
i know how much
you dislike him."	13.15102481842041
very well.	31.266210556030273
"how i long to see her again!	20.492752075195312
he sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	27.584915161132812
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	19.557937622070312
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	28.304079055786133
it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."	46.18815231323242
at last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with
great perseverance.	77.64947509765625
my poor father!	14.875457763671875
but with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
chance of it."	24.9520320892334
when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	32.33555603027344
elizabeth could not but look surprised.	55.92942810058594
in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.	27.929542541503906
but i know the
foundation is unjust.	15.182247161865234
"oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"	71.93236541748047
"a great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	19.11925506591797
they are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."	31.81694793701172
this
unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at pemberley to-day."	149.69976806640625
"well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.	34.46862030029297
she began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	33.5643310546875
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	79.06703186035156
"no, no.	34.7138557434082
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said
elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	47.724884033203125
she wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country."	24.55278778076172
"that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	55.76911163330078
"i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."	19.617950439453125
to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	26.60917854309082
it drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	30.120153427124023
"true.	33.70408630371094
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."	17.94552230834961
will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"	20.234962463378906
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	37.07305908203125
_too
much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	7.175948619842529
elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.	25.465593338012695
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	49.10242462158203
"what can be the meaning of this!"	34.299625396728516
elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	34.711456298828125
lady catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	36.531822204589844
at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!	20.091806411743164
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	30.88933753967285
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	42.833534240722656
"indeed, mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"	29.91094207763672
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	33.100799560546875
but i must write no more.	27.401405334472656
not that
i care about it, though.	69.8235092163086
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "mr bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	28.266407012939453
assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	32.94853210449219
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	92.40130615234375
"he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	46.470436096191406
the two youngest of the family,
catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.	38.3353271484375
darcy,
as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	106.6728744506836
who should suffer but myself?	48.004966735839844
"this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said
elizabeth.	28.562307357788086
"i never can be thankful, mr bennet, for any thing about the entail.	24.059326171875
but think no more of the letter.	46.46782302856445
however, i did not hear above one word in ten,
for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.	33.003326416015625
this is my advice.	34.00316619873047
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	37.825897216796875
they could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for mr darcy.	24.15711784362793
i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	18.622974395751953
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity.	52.795082092285156
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	31.924705505371094
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.	56.76572799682617
lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.	28.8120174407959
but really, and upon my
honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you
are satisfied."	81.24169158935547
there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	42.109222412109375
it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	7.990567684173584
but every body is to
judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i
assure you.	39.88994598388672
with the kindest concern he
     came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart.	32.987518310546875
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	22.643836975097656
--cried elizabeth.	40.58039855957031
"how nicely we are crammed in!"	31.441102981567383
"well, and what news does it bring?	23.64066505432129
"yes, yes, they must marry.	26.131410598754883
follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, i own, and i
laugh at them whenever i can.--but these, i suppose, are precisely what
you are without."	45.60593032836914
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	37.23851776123047
are any of your
younger sisters out, miss bennet?"	26.306520462036133
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn, before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals.	14.972420692443848
"no, she would go home.	23.369834899902344
elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	43.049434661865234
i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.	17.779563903808594

i see the imprudence
of it.--oh!	26.22944450378418
if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	38.970767974853516
balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	24.96185302734375
they have some of the finest woods in the
country."	28.777711868286133
as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	22.758211135864258
the very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	38.195777893066406
arguments are too much like disputes.	44.24464416503906
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."	26.83854103088379
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	31.134130477905273
but it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."	70.1271743774414
they repulsed
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr collins, who was complimenting mr bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	29.349369049072266
elizabeth could bear it no longer.	51.4730224609375
"he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam.	22.4660701751709
"nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair.	35.34800720214844
"you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	21.063650131225586
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."	24.71841049194336
"with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it."	26.287931442260742
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire.	42.74250793457031
if an
individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are
located in the united states, we do not claim a right to prevent you from

so
genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every
body.--_that_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."	36.04526138305664
it soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	14.349851608276367
"and they are really to be married!"	27.810640335083008
it was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	16.390981674194336
her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	25.53660011291504
vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!	33.79285430908203
"my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."	30.91533088684082
teazing, teazing, man!	34.399757385253906
how much you
must have gone through!"	32.24934387207031
while in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family!	48.96043014526367
darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right.	47.28489685058594
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth.	33.9766731262207
"is my father in town?"	51.32221221923828
she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	30.6904239654541
said miss bingley; "will
she be as tall as i am?"	31.5095272064209
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	25.791189193725586
he was silent.	31.733116149902344
he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.	22.97123908996582
there is a lady, it seems, a
     mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.	30.0916805267334
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"	22.933929443359375
tell him i hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	26.100637435913086
i do not deserve it.	39.15381622314453
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness."	36.307987213134766
occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.	110.9240951538086
i am prodigiously proud of him.	46.57337951660156
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	41.272464752197266
oh, that i knew how it was!"	22.098648071289062
"of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	31.188655853271484
"no, i should have turned in a moment."	28.685033798217773
it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	16.483322143554688
but not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	40.222442626953125
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	66.64000701904297
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
jane certainly could not come back.	32.40523910522461
you see how continually we are engaged there.	45.744712829589844
i have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--not that i have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.	22.139873504638672
all field sports were over.	49.98542785644531
"my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request.	31.992738723754883
she cried.--"i, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--i, who have valued myself on my abilities!	22.738008499145508
she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr collins
instead!	21.318906784057617
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	22.401004791259766
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	5.888926029205322
"my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	35.42359924316406
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.	41.613059997558594
supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin?	38.05199432373047
women fancy admiration means more than
it does."	11.089384078979492
she could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	18.9669189453125
it is evident that you belong to the
first circles.	14.813754081726074
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall i own that i long for your return?	43.567874908447266
kitty, run down and order the carriage.	48.87873840332031
"but how did he account for
it?"	33.01726150512695
the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	40.91976547241211
what do
you keep winking at me for?	26.85283660888672
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	47.96156692504883
i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.	19.008983612060547
"lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	22.812171936035156
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	42.255271911621094
"but it is," returned she; "for mrs long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."	35.96863555908203
"mr
collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	49.336997985839844
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	14.526326179504395
for
     about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation.	40.89744186401367
she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	27.654468536376953
the supposition did not pain her.	31.515546798706055
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam.	52.037025451660156
"now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said mr bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	33.16283416748047
his belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	15.88119888305664
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	90.68668365478516
elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	30.40072250366211
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	29.589603424072266
but do you
always write such charming long letters to her, mr darcy?"	24.927026748657227
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley.	33.426597595214844
i _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.	36.688663482666016
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation "the foundation"
or pglaf, owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project
gutenberg-tm electronic works.	27.734989166259766
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	30.711965560913086
do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	39.88760757446289
"my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london."	24.375347137451172
"i hope not."	34.129180908203125
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.	28.24228858947754
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton.	62.40453338623047
the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield.	24.29248046875
the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	76.77481079101562
it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	23.303491592407227
elizabeth was distressed.	40.84651184082031
with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise
full.--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	28.364233016967773
you know i have.	18.376832962036133
"his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."	38.17490005493164
"aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."	28.58806037902832
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth:

     "my dearest lizzy,

     "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	18.497453689575195
they found mr bennet still up.	37.94972229003906
his pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."	48.96640396118164
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.	39.66486358642578
then addressing her daughter, "oh!	21.077720642089844
the more i see
of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	40.20676803588867
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	39.38211441040039
the insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would
i give to hear your strictures on them!"	41.296546936035156
"i am
sorry it went off.	47.56182861328125
"and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me!	19.794139862060547
could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	68.45637512207031
she was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	52.66596603393555
"haye-park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
too far off!	33.113128662109375
you shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	27.28721046447754
i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_.	26.522972106933594
and even mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.	43.97226333618164
it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	25.571157455444336
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	31.17070770263672
"oh!	24.63828468322754
they were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something!	23.10245704650879
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	27.755001068115234
but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	30.892786026000977
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and
the children.	65.99349212646484
elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	18.29876708984375
he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
lucases.	26.610841751098633
--it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	67.0466079711914
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.	37.48823928833008
it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	30.919889450073242
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."	29.334339141845703
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	33.06779098510742
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him."	43.294498443603516
"really, mr collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	27.15635108947754
that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	18.084104537963867
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	20.88756561279297
"my dear niece,

     "i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as i foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what i have to tell you.	32.704708099365234
colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr darcy they had
only seen at church.	28.657974243164062
is nothing due to me on that
score?	36.63439178466797
sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	31.897281646728516
mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	30.403127670288086
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	34.59987258911133
mr collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library, he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him, and
lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose fordyce's sermons.	23.47749900817871
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both.	15.603751182556152
"i dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	42.156639099121094
"this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	48.22365951538086
limited right of replacement or refund - if you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.	35.066078186035156
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	22.829952239990234
his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	6.818669319152832
i
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, i am thus rejected.	7.834963321685791
it is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
     think of us.	24.972938537597656
those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."	75.72041320800781
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy.	30.68222999572754
he seldom appeared really
animated.	18.587217330932617
but it is of small importance."	36.62343215942383
what an agreeable man sir
william is, mr bingley--is not he?	45.80378723144531
he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	27.858661651611328
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"	43.897159576416016
"if your master would marry, you might see more of him."	25.415687561035156
my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	28.908536911010742
mr darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	40.91727828979492
i was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	19.238239288330078
--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	37.460060119628906
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country.	47.0394172668457
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"	31.257654190063477
what a contrast between him and his friend!	16.68947410583496
only look at her.	36.06048583984375
but little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	21.2808780670166
"yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	1.8288949728012085

they shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	19.347047805786133
what are you telling miss bennet?	14.117846488952637
oh!	38.613121032714844
"having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	11.471451759338379
cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?"	23.72101593017578
"you look pale.	21.296571731567383
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	58.55769729614258
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.	34.252845764160156
poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	34.08900833129883
she went on.	76.78978729248047
i
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes.	28.221803665161133
if there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
miss de bourgh.	124.25852966308594
but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is.	30.907970428466797
she was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.	30.463186264038086
"mr darcy!"	86.24481964111328
the moral will be perfectly fair.	25.42193603515625
she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."	42.7333984375
"upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	32.88691711425781
he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.	29.755462646484375
as her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	27.61424446105957
she
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	64.83177947998047
"beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	40.58489990234375
"i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	23.41790199279785
for forty years, he produced and distributed project
gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	31.72783088684082
"you are mistaken.	21.95508575439453
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	28.625354766845703
mr
darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	42.47490692138672
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	24.09677505493164
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	13.607413291931152
the
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	26.40884780883789
almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	54.292789459228516
they were off saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight.	31.754587173461914
we seem to have been designed for each
other."	31.698997497558594
i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	16.09554100036621
such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	31.944040298461914
as the day of his arrival drew near,

"i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister.	36.87325668334961
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that mr darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself.	25.548810958862305
we acted with the best intentions."	16.752559661865234
"i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	37.4964714050293
"i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, "_i_ can
hardly be just to him."	45.83887481689453
conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long."	23.23299789428711
our situation
with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	13.742751121520996
mrs hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	21.885351181030273
but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.	20.301359176635742
he confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	11.665816307067871
did you see it?"	23.688554763793945
but in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair.	20.042896270751953
elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	38.7612419128418
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn-house.	40.77199172973633
she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	43.004859924316406
"i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	31.456180572509766
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	68.71881103515625
"she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	24.933523178100586
his coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.	29.52609634399414
if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it."	64.0892333984375
"the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	20.692550659179688
i expected
you to stay two months.	25.146791458129883
then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	21.498245239257812
"and what is your success?"	34.0428581237793
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs
bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	28.11388397216797
"very much."	13.940936088562012
there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	23.48516845703125
he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	2.3219902515411377
she was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	14.325236320495605
"can you come to-morrow?"	24.44626235961914
if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	68.45549774169922
lord!	34.76821517944336
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton.	20.88713264465332
"how can you be smiling so,
lizzy?"	25.6262149810791
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	24.25063705444336
sir, i do indeed.	21.78909683227539
my aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing."	21.390512466430664
of having another daughter married to mr collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	31.071935653686523
we have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	43.575416564941406
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	31.87247085571289
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	11.707409858703613
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	33.968666076660156
he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there.	26.17831039428711
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued
absence.	40.27923583984375
"did charlotte dine with you?"	27.55084228515625
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	16.144258499145508
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.	33.35029220581055
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	39.843055725097656
the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	41.10702133178711
there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."	39.805335998535156
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield
because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him.	30.43804359436035
but mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	31.445833206176758
elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	30.162317276000977
one ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!	39.038108825683594
but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	23.92308235168457
my dear hill, have you
heard the good news?	37.324161529541016
"but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king?	17.91609001159668
sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	35.2655143737793
well, my comfort is, i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."	44.665184020996094
the
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.	38.793739318847656
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"	175.5808868408203
lydia's being settled in the
north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	21.602787017822266
her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	42.43705368041992
--she could have added, "a young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
manner!"	52.64590835571289
i quite forgot!	14.827475547790527
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton.	15.314342498779297
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	15.035974502563477
as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	6.8001227378845215
mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	35.02708435058594
"never, sir."	29.23921775817871
the party did not supply much conversation.	31.137826919555664
you have delighted us long enough.	27.809917449951172
and gravely glancing
at mr darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i
shall keep mine to swell my song."	32.75197982788086
"you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	12.830153465270996
their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	41.16962432861328
"yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it?"	4.911877632141113
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	26.522972106933594
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.	21.770418167114258
its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	17.276491165161133
thank god!	27.43207550048828
"oh!	40.275569915771484

"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.	43.152286529541016
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation
and you!	26.0191707611084
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	54.05339431762695
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	26.625272750854492
elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord,
how tired i am!"	26.47108268737793
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of mr darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	38.19137191772461
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	40.50816345214844
whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.	43.57978057861328
"certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can
dance."	41.7259521484375
"no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	63.44779968261719
"if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	33.992000579833984
she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	28.987180709838867
she talked to elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	23.233795166015625
upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.	11.343598365783691
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	28.11583709716797
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as mr gardiner could do.	37.36174011230469
perhaps i am not doing her justice.	38.129886627197266
mr wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return.	29.39670753479004
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	14.783370018005371
the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	42.63834762573242
they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	35.23335266113281
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	31.053466796875
i am so
pleased--so happy.	26.153318405151367
though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	17.954872131347656
"sir, you quite misunderstand me," said mrs bennet, alarmed.	7.581129550933838
if you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	12.133520126342773
she practises very constantly."	31.650543212890625
cried
jane.	20.38949203491211
"oh!"	26.522972106933594
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.	30.17072868347168
your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	27.456710815429688
"oh!	30.417802810668945
and with a bow to mr darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many
stared.--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	29.93689727783203
said she.	31.632844924926758
she dreaded seeing wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	28.130985260009766
i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."	18.902565002441406
the
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	31.879850387573242
there, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	22.852041244506836
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!	17.19774055480957
allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza, glancing
at her sister and bingley, shall take place.	26.65886878967285
his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	33.22346496582031
they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	33.698726654052734
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs
collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	42.964298248291016
as to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	57.7430305480957
elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	43.0632209777832
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	9.949395179748535
"who do you mean, my dear?	110.20297241210938
he was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	39.77892303466797
"your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.	25.269527435302734
"did not you?	24.609630584716797
"i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception.	27.426700592041016
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.	45.43870162963867
we can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	51.83557891845703
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	29.99000358581543
"i do not know when i have been more shocked," said she.	39.054813385009766
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married.	13.579253196716309
"merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.	32.80167770385742
she opened the
door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"oh, my dear eliza!	29.971397399902344
we have heard nothing from town."	23.53005599975586
i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."	53.76880645751953
after an affectionate
parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to mr and mrs gardiner, though unknown.	36.25685119628906
i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     william collins."	23.98981475830078
but it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	30.224903106689453
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here?	23.73279571533203
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as
to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.	51.39353942871094
by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	26.747974395751953
his
friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
ten days time.	27.355066299438477
who could have done less for her?	43.763877868652344
lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	23.39027976989746
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.	10.330763816833496
she is almost three and twenty!	40.190513610839844
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	37.614349365234375
added elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."	89.41815948486328
send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly.	16.799184799194336
she saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."	40.185001373291016
"indeed i had.	37.724117279052734
i can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_i_ have seen nothing of it."	34.190330505371094
"good gracious!	18.41010093688965
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	27.910409927368164
mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	38.534549713134766
every body said how well
she looked; and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	23.69713020324707
after a short silence, the lady first spoke.	25.984851837158203
mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.	34.208675384521484
but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	66.32868957519531
that had
his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as mr bingley, was incomprehensible.	24.256906509399414
"i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	40.13607406616211
mr darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	24.237504959106445
"you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."	29.920806884765625
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	32.59260177612305
they were in ----
     street.	24.800134658813477
he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	23.915815353393555
no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	66.9137191772461
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	45.47211456298828
after discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	84.02194213867188
she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	19.246896743774414
"not as you represent it.	25.831972122192383
but, really, i know not what to say.	29.040700912475586
you know i always
speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	26.522972106933594
nonsense, how can you talk so!	14.11486530303955
when she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr
darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining mr bingley for his sister.	25.32487678527832
"oh!	69.5507583618164
gardiner."	54.04261016845703
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.	37.663490295410156
i came to you without a
doubt of my reception.	23.092973709106445
she had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	44.59456253051758
"your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	23.446470260620117
"my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else!	45.22519302368164
he added, that mr
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and
promised to write again very soon.	24.911373138427734
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	18.154605865478516
if i was to go through the world, i could not
meet with a better.	43.86363983154297
jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.	46.384918212890625
this must be the grossest falsehood!"	38.4769172668457
well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	22.882173538208008
"and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."	26.35281753540039
"what would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?"	87.22185516357422
"in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	19.182476043701172
'lady
catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'	18.528335571289062
"yes; to the last.	30.297222137451172
but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.	21.383146286010742
observed mrs bennet.	26.583173751831055
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more."	60.64309310913086
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	28.782501220703125
he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.	44.05697250366211
elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.	29.959272384643555
your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.	45.217288970947266
i am sick of them all.	41.496620178222656
i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	20.57864761352539
"you appear to me, mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.	38.487186431884766
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	54.14358901977539
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when mr hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	41.05170440673828
if your
feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.	20.7471866607666
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	16.43792724609375
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	29.524702072143555
he made no answer.	21.78706169128418
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in paragraph 1.f.3.	51.39680099487305
in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	23.974416732788086
but i am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--they were excessively sorry to go!	47.36521911621094
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.	20.988603591918945
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	31.48278045654297
"good heavens!"	29.82309913635254
but
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	33.97733688354492
at first there
seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	37.56569290161133
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be very tolerable.	50.35836410522461
jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	30.306800842285156
miss darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	30.146162033081055
i came to try you.	34.52198028564453
"if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	43.970184326171875
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	24.003803253173828
at length the parsonage was discernible.	12.273947715759277
"except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate."	22.523096084594727
let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	152.7176971435547
yes.	15.625903129577637
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	22.216320037841797
but does not jane
correspond with the sister?	41.77971267700195
mr darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding.	15.427290916442871
from that moment i
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then
     perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had
     ever witnessed in him.	21.474084854125977
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?	13.517708778381348
we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	151.326416015625
they were of a respectable family in
the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	23.087722778320312
the express was sent off directly.	44.72502899169922
but enough of this.	19.729759216308594
but, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	22.395212173461914
and is it really true?	18.05276870727539
their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	24.41551971435547
this, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
were not decidedly better.	44.98895263671875
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.	11.839757919311523
to be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he
_did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
about mr robinson."	28.07849884033203
the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."	23.64502716064453
"and what arts did he use to separate them?"	28.68805503845215
i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."	49.55585479736328
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	24.963682174682617
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	29.11637306213379
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	35.674991607666016
to persuade him against
     returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.	11.539173126220703
it would have suited
me in every respect."	46.33989715576172
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	34.62736129760742
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	28.2701358795166
their manners are not equal to his."	11.72318172454834
in
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	25.226219177246094
he
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	18.236072540283203
and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in
debt; but i hope this may be false."	27.8260498046875
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	52.571311950683594
"you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth.	23.360565185546875
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	58.47825622558594
but do not be cast down.	23.856855392456055
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	15.720739364624023
i have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	28.44420623779297
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.	30.9306583404541
it is a pity they are not handsome!	21.4881649017334
they can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."	35.8836669921875
"elizabeth, you are not serious now."	121.31487274169922
i thought
we never should have got into the coach.	20.99169158935547
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	9.69222354888916
"and quite alone?	21.533002853393555
shall you like to have such a brother?"	22.11174964904785
may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"	37.223331451416016
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	26.264907836914062
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	42.4698371887207
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."	39.08794021606445
while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at st. james's.	33.8393440246582
elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.	44.18529510498047
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	37.11444854736328
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	32.56730270385742
"there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	44.76887512207031
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	8.907145500183105
"yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	14.11486530303955
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	23.8358097076416
mrs bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	30.290245056152344
gardiner."	27.320737838745117
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.	40.1473388671875
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	29.038230895996094
she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet.	31.551889419555664
if i had ever learnt, i
should have been a great proficient.	81.41069030761719
i am sincerely grieved for him and
     mrs f. but no one can throw any blame on them.	66.74456787109375
"not so much as i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his
time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months."	6.6280951499938965
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	14.152639389038086
"nor i, i am sure," said miss bingley.	29.540929794311523
i should infinitely prefer a book."	33.197998046875
"such as vanity and pride."	21.840124130249023
"compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	28.563745498657227
my dear mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	22.548768997192383
"but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.	17.606773376464844
"i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	29.28763771057129
i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."	28.773048400878906
she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.	35.434242248535156
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.	34.64082336425781
"i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	45.7521858215332
besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."	129.04840087890625
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	33.15855407714844
"something very much to the purpose of course.	38.342620849609375
who would
have thought it!	24.117952346801758
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	20.89447021484375
mr bingley and jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.	28.106046676635742
"i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	38.58492660522461
- you provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.	65.37459564208984
darcy said
nothing at all.	24.47498321533203
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.	9.438172340393066
"of whom does jane ever think ill?	32.15293502807617
you will hardly bear to be
long outdone by jane.	34.967838287353516
what will become of me.	36.01517105102539
his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."	19.94766616821289
"it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth.	30.50716781616211
elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	105.46444702148438
to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh?	29.019800186157227
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."	47.15652847290039
1.f.2.	34.485931396484375
a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.	28.517101287841797
the
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness!	21.81884765625
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence; mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	27.244014739990234
mrs gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	24.6557674407959
but it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."	20.000701904296875
"indeed you are mistaken.	46.09843826293945
what made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	20.60764503479004
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	23.888906478881836
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.	30.24382209777832
at length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	32.45479202270508
their reception from mr bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	16.599868774414062
every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	50.5575065612793
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
bingley.	12.084118843078613
i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	47.74106979370117
mr
hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	39.5505256652832
could there be
finer symptoms?	27.653261184692383
she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.	32.05148696899414
"not one."	35.91727066040039
my excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant.	34.903656005859375
"yes," thought elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.	25.1636962890625
rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	24.919235229492188
when you told mrs
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	66.90660095214844
"that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	52.94970703125
at such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	42.16281509399414
what has she to do with it?	18.393381118774414
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."	49.730079650878906
he had been some time with mr gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning.	29.227649688720703
do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."	42.03630828857422
in another minute mr bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	22.043874740600586
he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	10.63772201538086
"would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	12.133520126342773
console lady catherine as well as
     you can.	31.864391326904297
can copy and distribute it in the united states without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.	34.57918167114258
"oh!"	34.953521728515625
that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."	16.648536682128906
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	39.12160110473633
his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	12.418673515319824
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
i assure you.	39.498817443847656
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	29.386037826538086
"you used us abominably ill," answered mrs hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."	22.6708984375
"on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession
to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.	17.689260482788086
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	111.64358520507812
"would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	28.42183494567871
elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	33.625423431396484
what hours of transport we shall spend!	23.59615707397461
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.	36.051570892333984
there was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	20.88387680053711
"but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"	24.1868896484375
without a governess you must
have been neglected."	46.27931594848633
elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	21.16082763671875
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you
say that he was at rosings?"	22.28257179260254
they all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.	34.432945251464844
elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	30.324098587036133
the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	27.296186447143555
and when i returned home, the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	29.2321720123291
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
discourage him."	34.340599060058594
how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you."	50.46373748779297
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming.	31.60069465637207
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	35.487998962402344
it is of no consequence.	28.27689552307129
i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	19.516794204711914
and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"the men shan't come and part us, i am determined.	29.66461944580078
"eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it
succeeds.	30.366111755371094
"most willingly."	27.78300666809082
"it keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express."	5.587969779968262
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings.	27.55925178527832
when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	38.20510482788086
"_her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	28.359811782836914
i am glad he dines here on tuesday.	27.371849060058594
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	41.190799713134766
he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	32.058021545410156
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	1.5946553945541382
first of all, he asked miss lucas.	34.64326477050781
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
ill at netherfield?"	31.911075592041016
1.f.3.	3.473991632461548
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you
will be satisfied with what i have done.	28.034509658813477
i know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.	19.017087936401367
good gracious!	11.680368423461914
"no; but it must be done soon."	45.461997985839844
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	33.58180618286133
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist mr wickham with money."	11.232840538024902
"a little."	40.30329895019531
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	23.905986785888672
yet he is _such_ a man!"	16.043212890625
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and mr collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs philips.--the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.	12.745511054992676
--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could
not hesitate."	22.163917541503906
but it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."	7.295829772949219
i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	22.770221710205078
she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	26.178720474243164
her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."	33.82695770263672
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?"	16.305721282958984
kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.	23.684415817260742
oh, lydia!"	31.231916427612305
you must learn some
of my philosophy.	11.135085105895996
the dejection was almost
universal.	20.127111434936523
she has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne's.	26.684417724609375
on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	29.34393882751465
he walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; charlotte tried to console her.	13.1953125
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	13.991415023803711
"write to me very often, my dear."	27.619606018066406
our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia's character.	50.51449203491211
we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	15.0983304977417
i dare say i shall
soon see them here."	42.07618713378906
it was
unpardonable.	43.746009826660156
you never see a fault in any body.	19.830657958984375
"oh, yes!--if one could but go to brighton!	29.33527946472168
it is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	23.91146469116211
"but upon my honour i do _not_.	25.25008201599121
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	41.13225555419922
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	30.62353515625
you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	37.75376510620117
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	14.188215255737305
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	39.525638580322266
to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	38.38045883178711
mr bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	19.99454689025879
said she, as she looked in
her face.	41.28826141357422
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	12.85209846496582
his own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited.	28.70528793334961
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to darcy,

"miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master.	12.051061630249023

works.	41.97560119628906
the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	32.24806594848633
said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam.	22.03207778930664
you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at pemberley with you."	17.393146514892578
hang kitty!	17.53457260131836
they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	18.11111831665039
"at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said mr bennet, as he folded up the letter.	26.427824020385742
miss bennet still looked all amazement.	21.36739158630371
elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention!	37.602622985839844
it was as
follows:

     "my dear sir,

     "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from hertfordshire.	38.51973342895508
mr collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	31.09879493713379
for, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	97.60687255859375
he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.	22.78444480895996
"but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."	9.632332801818848
"oh, well!	55.94981002807617
"now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to
table.	136.16468811035156
oh,
lord!	35.37095642089844
mr wickham began the subject himself.	11.574021339416504
"it must not be thought of.	13.634644508361816
till i was in kent, and saw
so much both of mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth myself.	13.4556884765625
why should they try to influence him?	27.7309513092041
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	21.396726608276367
bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	40.52878952026367
she is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
i will _make_ her know it."	34.20357894897461
elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	21.194049835205078
"i should be sorry indeed, if it were.	35.96644592285156
where is your sash my dear?"	32.2055778503418
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.	78.10784149169922
the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	43.91314697265625
elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	82.4461669921875
"and i certainly _never_ shall give it.	26.57084083557129
"then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
mr bingley to _her_."	8.90608024597168
how i wanted you!"	27.65180778503418
it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	28.28546142578125
thus, we do not necessarily
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	20.22754669189453
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	28.94413185119629
mrs hurst
thought the same, and added,

"she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	27.33595085144043
my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"	23.030136108398438
louisa and i were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."	36.3036994934082
it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr collins joining
in, observed,

"yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
be delighted with her.	23.10149383544922
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.	47.90409851074219
"i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want."	30.947662353515625
when they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be
soon married to mr bingley.--it was an animating subject, and mrs
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	43.36440658569336
she
looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	24.975479125976562
"i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton."	36.999202728271484
"very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.	25.069543838500977
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	21.91805648803711
it
was all pride and insolence.	21.379056930541992
"perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	22.586820602416992
as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	68.57856750488281
cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."	25.413082122802734
she
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	23.46232032775879
"of mr collins and lizzy.	28.75519561767578
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."	78.33143615722656
"i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	41.482357025146484
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.	38.61561584472656
_that_ is all to be forgot.	28.46626091003418
they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	23.96689224243164
it is just as he chooses.	5.549732208251953
soon after
     you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of london they were.	26.673147201538086
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	35.27902603149414
i write rather slowly."	12.700483322143555
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.	36.1333122253418
cried elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--how could
his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress?"	33.621150970458984
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	26.888687133789062
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	41.702308654785156
the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	20.033628463745117
they were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.	21.10605239868164
i will not tell you what it is.	230.79815673828125
darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	27.594287872314453
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to
satisfy.	18.07141876220703
"and my mother--how is she?	16.826370239257812
but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	29.91583251953125
the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	31.0599308013916
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."	32.55461883544922
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	21.798294067382812
no,
no--i feel he may defy us there.	36.39276123046875
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	16.483427047729492
i shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	23.95442771911621
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	8.068878173828125
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	1.8288949728012085
"kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully.	37.86051559448242
1.e.7.	22.617155075073242
oh!	54.29478073120117
what could your ladyship propose by it?"	25.93630027770996
what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?	33.53925323486328
"what, none of you?"	29.87261962890625
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!	20.713712692260742
it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way.	47.48550033569336
"yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	33.79665756225586
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	63.6557731628418
i cannot find
out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	36.77260971069336
"not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."	43.69606018066406
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth!	11.455044746398926
you have liked many a
stupider person."	26.50931167602539
"and this is always the way with him," she added.--"whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	31.699827194213867
to caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit.	27.710573196411133
"your's, &c."

this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	2.7356879711151123
"i should like it beyond any thing!"	42.23809051513672
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	16.994699478149414
then pray speak aloud.	47.42304992675781
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	36.03403854370117
jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	45.9841194152832
"lizzy, you must not do so.	49.125553131103516
i am not at all afraid of her dying.	21.55879020690918
"i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr bennet.	43.79427719116211
i have by no means done.	13.223991394042969
her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"there are very few people of whom so much can be said.	26.53762435913086
"you quite mistook mr darcy.	20.841426849365234
"undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	28.1934757232666
"it must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."	22.986309051513672
there was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	28.594884872436523
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	26.48291778564453
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	22.00670051574707
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	15.368363380432129
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	24.424964904785156
there was one part
especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the
power of reading again.	50.87651443481445
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	21.052038192749023
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	27.77193260192871
but the
clothes, the wedding clothes!	24.421924591064453
it was lady catherine de bourgh.	12.015316009521484
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	68.45938110351562
in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."	35.036865234375
it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.	38.69202423095703
she has known him only a fortnight.	32.57150650024414
at any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."	24.06587028503418
but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the
trouble of practising.	18.416133880615234
"lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."	26.81015968322754
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	18.555828094482422
there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."	22.58576011657715
but mr gardiner
     could not be seen, and mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning.	22.789297103881836
mr
darcy may hug himself."	28.622543334960938
she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be mr darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	17.32573699951172
but she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	24.866777420043945
she is all affability and condescension, and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	36.64383316040039
i want to be told whether i
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham's character."	22.545000076293945
between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	28.920671463012695
*       *       *       *       *

the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs bennet's curiosity; and
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	17.876502990722656
i ought not to have said a word about it.	24.49244499206543
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins.	32.242061614990234
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
pemberley.	20.35986328125
little more than half a day's
journey.	33.56427764892578
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	31.671537399291992
he was received by mrs
bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	25.925704956054688
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss
bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	28.815509796142578
pray, how _violent was_ mr bingley's
love?"	54.938148498535156
"if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside," cried bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."	32.92169189453125
"that is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	26.775983810424805
"perhaps that is not possible for any one.	26.606239318847656
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
meet mr darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--yet it did, and even a third.	48.273399353027344
you will find her manners beyond any
thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	24.483732223510742
mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	23.862794876098633
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr darcy!"	25.777963638305664
you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	16.22138786315918
it was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	33.16178894042969
i speak nothing but the truth.	24.265472412109375
and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.	16.24262809753418
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	30.449825286865234
and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."	43.78892135620117
again she read on.	18.234203338623047
but i have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."	56.81547164916992
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	22.285982131958008
it is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."	65.56474304199219
next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	16.644794464111328
you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."	26.522972106933594
you were
not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.	29.325693130493164
do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."	29.663902282714844
"oh!	21.692968368530273
"how despicably have i acted!"	36.02470397949219
mr bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	38.19985580444336
allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	22.0316219329834
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	21.130512237548828
"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."	20.08372688293457
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	29.297548294067383
"are they indeed?"	23.045536041259766
on opening the door, she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	46.20212936401367
she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	20.8173828125
said he,
with a look of doubt.	28.74405288696289
bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
principal object.	28.06537437438965
"i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."	14.217181205749512
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth; but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"oh!	27.731624603271484
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	16.673320770263672
_my_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."	35.22319793701172
mrs
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with mr bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.	24.706663131713867
"is he married or single?"	23.68828010559082
yes, miss
bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	28.78202247619629
he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton.	25.362520217895508
elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	28.37317657470703
"i am talking of possibilities, charles."	14.29291820526123
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	29.991241455078125
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	33.70576095581055
mrs bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	12.904343605041504
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	30.757118225097656
i believe i have now told you every thing.	30.94936752319336
mrs bennet could hardly
contain herself.	22.49118995666504
she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.	16.034208297729492
you know not what you are
about."	50.70113754272461
"yes, very handsome."	25.104490280151367
i will have no reserves from _you_."	14.402555465698242
it was some consolation to
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.	27.704418182373047
i am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but i hardly know what i have written."	15.096526145935059
his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	26.380735397338867
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them.	13.814289093017578
there is
one point, on which i want your advice.	24.545082092285156
his circumstances, he
     assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad.	43.590763092041016
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	21.878820419311523
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.	105.48465728759766
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time.	19.029661178588867
jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	39.72164535522461
and so did mrs
forster.	36.51116180419922
"they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."	31.396135330200195
thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!"	46.77539825439453
elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal."	43.59196090698242
"you judge very properly," said mr bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	5.496817588806152
you must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	26.522972106933594
"and do you impute it to either of those?"	35.03823471069336
cried lydia.	20.066617965698242
"oh!	27.467933654785156
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	44.79901123046875
"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them."	40.79646682739258
"you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short
silence.	23.64552879333496
we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.	26.38140869140625
it was over at last however.	22.371437072753906
mr wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family.	26.083744049072266
they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	45.59437561035156
if he _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never
     disgrace him.	16.43389129638672
and tell my dear
lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	52.32771682739258
such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	23.727031707763672
in that case he would return no more.	16.824268341064453
my feelings will not be
repressed.	13.323786735534668
remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."	35.28507614135742
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael
hart, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark.	19.16187286376953
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	20.17134666442871
your tempers are by no means unlike.	40.191959381103516
and in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	15.393353462219238
"you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."	38.775699615478516
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of mr darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	51.551692962646484
"design!	46.419002532958984
her father lifted up his eyes.	20.15744972229004
she was ashamed to think how
much.	33.31076431274414
for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr
darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."	20.88799476623535
and
what do you think she said besides?	16.755455017089844
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	28.833932876586914
i must beg to return to
the house."	36.38522720336914
as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	17.541913986206055
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	17.871408462524414
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield.	22.481760025024414
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

lydia declared herself satisfied.	30.196596145629883
thought elizabeth.	31.57325553894043
his
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	45.14997482299805
she was very
equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	26.522972106933594
his character was decided.	34.63988494873047
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	30.895849227905273
"oh!	23.955602645874023
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	18.311363220214844
"i do not recollect that we did."	33.36775588989258
elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.	10.790593147277832
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	40.57505416870117
on miss lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must."	24.726280212402344
"a great deal of good management, depend upon it.	54.66775894165039
but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.	35.14704513549805
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	13.270846366882324
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.	1.8288949728012085
we have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
     approve.	24.991836547851562
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will
     immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.	22.2259578704834
oh!	54.36870193481445
to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	65.80460357666016
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success.	19.197566986083984
were it for nothing but his love of you, i
must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me.	18.991905212402344
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	46.66496658325195
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"	22.057802200317383
"what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?"	26.121681213378906
but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	51.08224868774414
she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."	23.55451774597168
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	54.492679595947266
"i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	31.42304229736328
it would have been strange if they had.	28.89740753173828
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	39.05025100708008
to all the
objections i have already urged, i have still another to add.	38.14113235473633
"and what did she say?"	23.321592330932617
"i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.	37.81795120239258
do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	33.10246658325195
"how can you talk so?"	29.470510482788086
"lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	28.081865310668945
certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."	23.25591468811035
"the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	62.8996467590332
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	25.507484436035156
"there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	35.5703125
i
always had a value for him.	27.669628143310547
my father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	22.947656631469727
i am quite well.	51.33206558227539
i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	40.97773742675781
--my mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right
     honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the church of england.	30.87799835205078
no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	9.078797340393066
they would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.	29.047855377197266
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	25.27943992614746
yours ever,

     "caroline bingley."	52.2801399230957
his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	11.455554962158203
something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	17.87857437133789
she could think only of her letter.	33.04697799682617
who attended to you?	44.03474807739258
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs
philips's manners and politeness.	105.46444702148438
i
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	40.18758773803711
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them.	19.1615047454834
1.e.3.	25.576025009155273
jane looked at her doubtingly.	19.24635887145996
at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	13.923818588256836
nor was darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	21.510143280029297
"her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament.	37.76858139038086
my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!	25.1337890625
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	29.451231002807617
he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	36.909976959228516
and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless.	31.31498908996582
"yes, i have had a letter from him by express."	20.93644142150879
"to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham;
or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.	10.111007690429688
i roused, and
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_.	27.64149284362793
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	26.023067474365234
"yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it."	25.704975128173828
those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as mrs forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	14.961865425109863
when first mr bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	22.67160415649414
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	30.361953735351562
its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	25.122520446777344
and
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information.	35.55632781982422
"none at all.	27.622739791870117
the old lady is mrs jenkinson, who lives with them.	26.160478591918945
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.	30.576271057128906
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.	43.30674743652344
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	49.621273040771484
certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	7.80703592300415
"you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs nicholls was in
meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	16.57185173034668
i do not think it
is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.	16.9670352935791
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?	41.28263854980469
"we never had any governess."	63.95713806152344
she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	15.443706512451172
"oh, yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt.	36.53727722167969
"but you--how are you?"	34.479042053222656
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, i am sure.	41.50592041015625
but he is a
liberal master, i suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."	4.444070816040039
these parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	26.961217880249023
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	28.75196075439453
where shall you change
horses?--oh!	39.47483825683594
"some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	21.67060661315918
"well, then--supposing them to be in london.	34.0335693359375
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley!	25.90926170349121
"implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	21.80510902404785
"your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."	9.167189598083496
"why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned.	15.235937118530273
but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--here you are in your own family."	70.67089080810547
"ah!	16.54589080810547
a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	27.143714904785156
they were to be off as soon as possible.	32.12321472167969
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	26.74771499633789
if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	31.884199142456055
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this
discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	30.48930549621582
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."	63.160099029541016
she tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	20.725887298583984
very little was said by either; kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	1.2401421070098877
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	26.822973251342773
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	33.45322799682617
thank heaven!	82.86663818359375
but
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	24.248764038085938
he has the
     promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the north.	33.0844612121582
he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	6.313326358795166
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy?"	22.412612915039062
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	34.63591384887695
stop me whilst you can."	43.8560905456543
"and can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"	15.94296932220459
there was no help
for it however.	43.408992767333984
can i speak plainer?	23.393848419189453
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for
elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	27.216890335083008
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?	49.810245513916016
the
adieu is charity itself.	22.835472106933594
indeed he has no improper pride.	41.162872314453125
how was that possible?	29.312829971313477
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	25.679126739501953
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch-street by noon.	33.231109619140625
"it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."	33.932064056396484
i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.	52.85919952392578
he is perfectly amiable.	36.56072235107422
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	13.571135520935059
cried elizabeth when she had
finished it.	33.8771858215332
that he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!	23.858978271484375
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	10.67493724822998
"how strange this is!	41.702091217041016
within doors there
was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	29.209306716918945
i can hardly write for
     laughing.	24.519193649291992
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.	20.29549789428711
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	26.130264282226562
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--though lydia had
never been a favourite with them, mr and mrs gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	18.713485717773438
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr darcy--that mr darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week.	21.099149703979492
"you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by
all means to refuse him."	10.536535263061523
they solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	31.952756881713867
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	50.952369689941406
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	23.52879524230957
and so, darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission!	27.078786849975586
it was then disclosed in the following
manner.	23.61893653869629
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for
himself."	20.917238235473633
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."	18.373720169067383
there
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	59.96934127807617
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for mr collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.	25.102144241333008
the children have been wanting me this half hour.	34.505619049072266
"no, my dear; i think not.	19.82027816772461
i was in the middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun."	26.819778442382812
"my dear, dear lydia!"	19.7833309173584
"it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	11.620598793029785
she was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."	43.440528869628906
mrs reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.	101.08882904052734
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	41.13789367675781
"but so we all do.	39.746028900146484
how is
such a man to be worked on?	37.805259704589844
the
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.	39.42155838012695
in future, i hope we shall be always of one
mind."	20.21098518371582
when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	24.688209533691406
i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.	11.8075590133667
i am so
grieved for him.	35.879756927490234
is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	18.49319076538086
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr
gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	28.737960815429688
wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to lydia's for him.	10.78980541229248
colonel fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	21.09894371032715
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family.	12.056042671203613
but papa is so
disagreeable."	19.84153938293457
it is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.	2.9356274604797363
i
thank you for explaining it so fully.	60.286415100097656
all were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	22.28828239440918
"obstinate, headstrong girl!	29.594844818115234
elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of mr darcy.	19.309724807739258
"i am sick of mr bingley," cried his wife.	30.672569274902344
*       *       *       *       *




transcriber's note:

spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency
within the book.	37.39912796020508
but no
such recollection befriended her.	32.00041198730469
those were your words.	29.310110092163086
"miss bennet, do you know who i am?	33.02389144897461
there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	41.77754211425781
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	48.531578063964844
he placed himself by her.	24.171117782592773
if, indeed, it should be so!	31.320945739746094
i shall like it of all
things.	18.50895881652832
i
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his
     society in town.	27.485183715820312
and to see dear wickham too!	21.489805221557617
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	76.22264862060547
"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."	42.274959564208984
in three volumes.	30.791208267211914
to know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	61.234737396240234
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	20.370458602905273
we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	47.28713607788086
a house in town!	13.736434936523438
professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.	23.657529830932617
the garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.	10.908188819885254
i am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     hunsford.	40.793907165527344
it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to mr darcy.	26.025936126708984
good or bad?"	16.512042999267578
and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north.	22.894254684448242
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	33.48208999633789
"probably not;--but mr darcy can please where he chuses.	8.966310501098633
he
cannot afford it.	27.35811424255371
and then when we came away it was such fun!	19.71402359008789
i guessed as much."	23.624858856201172
nobody can tell what i
suffer!--but it is always so.	44.342708587646484
"_that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."	59.91580581665039
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	24.0411319732666
the horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	14.741092681884766
she cried.	14.178898811340332
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.	28.007793426513672
absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr collins.	21.5759334564209
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	49.84778594970703
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried elizabeth.	9.773672103881836
as all
conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.	25.70718002319336
she was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.	25.01180648803711
all was joy and
kindness.	18.751049041748047
he made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.	24.814104080200195
a scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	11.234210968017578
"i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	15.418219566345215
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	20.326845169067383
so, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."	19.464391708374023
you supposed more than
     really existed.	29.44051170349121
poor kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder.	33.67676544189453
upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."	27.23040008544922
by this time she is
actually with them!	40.720027923583984
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	33.01317596435547
miss bingley said something of his never
     returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.	38.625938415527344
"wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	79.55724334716797
you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	25.76915740966797
i was afraid they might
not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was
determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like
any thing."	25.811986923217773
"indeed i could not.	25.558435440063477
the idea of mr collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	12.549040794372559
"i never heard that it was."	18.349668502807617
"this account then is what he has received from mr darcy.	23.782711029052734
it is a nice long walk, and mr darcy has
never seen the view."	21.03811264038086
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	24.315017700195312
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
detained first by the civility of mr collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	30.21438980102539
it
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	23.001298904418945
why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	4.776401042938232
"is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"	31.55476188659668
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	26.88728904724121
he bore it however with admirable calmness.	15.374958992004395
and there was my
aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	24.420642852783203
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"you look conscious.	36.239295959472656
"exceedingly well.	35.09644317626953
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?	26.81348991394043
i told my sister philips so the other day.	55.65605163574219
your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
you.	45.05177688598633
it convinced her, that
accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town.	24.378759384155273
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	35.250728607177734
if i may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."	26.050865173339844
"this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced."	25.762046813964844
was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	26.960407257080078
on finding
mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"	23.807645797729492
"i see your design, bingley," said his friend.--"you dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."	28.462007522583008
"then, who taught you?	35.556514739990234
though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	19.606185913085938
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!	49.077754974365234
when they
had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said,

"this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	38.47291946411133
he had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.	53.054046630859375
i
     take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not,
     but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible.	17.001691818237305
"_you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne
for fifty pounds!	40.86313247680664
"their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
i, nor any body, can ever forget.	9.116788864135742
secondly, that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness.	27.566913604736328
well, but now for
my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	11.772119522094727
and a
special licence.	12.052806854248047
calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.	161.90780639648438
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied darcy.	50.35478210449219
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	7.415510654449463
what is it about?	64.42686462402344
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	34.535133361816406
how can it affect them?"	19.962997436523438
"this is not to be borne.	33.25330352783203
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	21.46351432800293
mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than
mrs bennet and mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces.	25.356239318847656
i rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.	30.161006927490234
you have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.	22.316967010498047
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	22.044647216796875
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	72.19537353515625
elizabeth immediately began playing again.	11.807900428771973
you know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	26.522972106933594
"i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield.	23.927316665649414
it may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	28.252845764160156
"oh!	26.522972106933594
she looked at jane, to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
talking to bingley.	21.8803653717041
it is of all subjects my delight.	19.41518211364746
"oh!	32.867252349853516
"he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."	4.775814056396484
we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	10.329740524291992
"my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me.	10.065539360046387
those who do not complain are never
pitied."	34.54623031616211
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	23.682615280151367
with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed.	29.54851722717285
"we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire."	22.29979133605957
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	20.201528549194336
there was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	16.874149322509766
indeed, eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."	36.885501861572266
seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	45.68480682373047
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.	35.09734344482422
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	18.660768508911133
"that is as it happens.	15.849852561950684
"your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	40.663578033447266
you have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."	27.88596534729004
their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	62.21379089355469
"and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	15.116735458374023
mr darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to mrs collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	23.20921516418457
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	27.31743621826172
the
possibility of meeting mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	20.716699600219727
"lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	23.658103942871094
how is half such a sum to be
repaid?"	16.78568458557129
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling."	26.272167205810547
at present i will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	4.031723976135254
miss lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	36.067691802978516
his words
seemed to imply it.	24.06163787841797
make haste, make haste.	26.611988067626953
mrs bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	38.471309661865234
had the late mr darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life.	22.965055465698242
"but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	14.672213554382324
"i should imagine not."	19.424467086791992
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	38.93133544921875
but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them.	15.704405784606934
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	21.82613182067871
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	56.65558624267578
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	23.181053161621094
now is your time.	19.414915084838867
"he must be an oddity, i think," said she.	17.769620895385742
two days after mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask."	59.11326599121094
i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."	18.225383758544922
i shall send for my
     clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up.	29.921546936035156
march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford.	32.41278839111328
accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.	51.29990005493164
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	29.70219612121582
my dear mr bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?	35.352176666259766
but who was your mother?	63.51791000366211
mr collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and mr darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	21.47596549987793
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	17.377063751220703
how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	20.075048446655273
if you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	31.299057006835938
"we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--how much i shall have to tell!"	27.752227783203125
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs
gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	41.30127716064453
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	27.851449966430664
"all young ladies accomplished!	24.602994918823242
"i should never have said mrs collins
was settled _near_ her family."	32.92329025268555
mr
bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before."	34.95028305053711
mr darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"this walk is not wide enough for our party.	1.8288949728012085
jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw mr darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	30.676130294799805
it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's
attractions.	27.191730499267578
oh!	17.262399673461914
let us hope for
better things.	28.961828231811523
"you begin to comprehend me, do you?"	19.982633590698242
they were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	26.52754020690918
after
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.	25.44341278076172
"i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."	35.58139419555664
"my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	38.605247497558594
since her
father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."	10.070096015930176
if there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	23.039531707763672
so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	27.15751075744629
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	43.60542297363281
they walked on, without knowing in what direction.	24.37816047668457
he was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	11.578948020935059
i hope they will not meet at all.	28.774276733398438
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy."	48.05482482910156
she stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	96.50739288330078
"but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	20.367876052856445
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	17.45681381225586
"i know them a little.	12.133520126342773
it was first broken by mrs annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and mrs gardiner, with occasional help from
elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	28.92831802368164
promise me, therefore, to
come to hunsford."	29.909486770629883
"oh!"	34.45704650878906
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	18.280006408691406
and with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."	27.941715240478516
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	19.628162384033203
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	26.602075576782227
"well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
collinses live very comfortable, do they?	26.138612747192383
she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."	19.485990524291992
"but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.	16.52686882019043
their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	20.899450302124023
charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility.	26.522972106933594
but i make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	28.998628616333008
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you."	22.06985855102539
"oh!	17.694570541381836
"your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.	19.598222732543945
i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	29.15526580810547
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	10.289435386657715
it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."	25.60479164123535
but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
dare say, very agreeable.	32.26047134399414
it is useless to talk of it."	19.571125030517578
he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to elizabeth again, he walked away.	17.633914947509766
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	21.846908569335938
but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."	14.924827575683594
not that i am afraid
of _myself_, but i dread other people's remarks."	17.224565505981445
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with wickham!--imagine our surprise.	28.521703720092773
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"is not this nice?	25.158044815063477
"no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	17.861894607543945
"from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry."	19.611177444458008
if he fears me, why come hither?	11.59709358215332
mr jones says we must not think of moving her.	25.513444900512695
the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine's drawing-room.	24.41641616821289
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	27.463048934936523
he danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	25.697040557861328
"and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."	37.065860748291016
it will not do.	17.1088924407959
i enquired after their brother, of course.	23.00225257873535
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	33.34263610839844
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"	37.38151168823242
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, mr darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	31.717510223388672
"her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	21.732759475708008
but
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted.	24.817100524902344
to the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	18.00417137145996
through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	18.19752311706543
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.	75.65011596679688
if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	20.764965057373047
miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	18.045316696166992
mr collins was eloquent in her praise.	16.251020431518555
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	15.795730590820312
don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
     that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side.	21.464359283447266
i knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.	1.8288949728012085
elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	19.91877555847168
as they drove to mr gardiner's
door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	26.04598617553711
oh!	10.771590232849121
cried mrs gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	25.707744598388672
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	9.663568496704102
you are safe from me."	34.942344665527344
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	45.55133819580078
unfeeling, selfish girl!	27.458106994628906
"both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	23.838600158691406
"i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."	25.183761596679688
he only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."	38.084320068359375
she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."	23.828235626220703
she
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	27.317378997802734
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known sir william's too long.	25.33536148071289
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	36.31635665893555
mr and mrs gardiner smiled.	16.99626350402832
"the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	40.31097412109375
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	33.528480529785156
let me never see either
one or the other again!"	30.579952239990234
it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	19.402244567871094
if i could but see _you_ as happy!	12.376387596130371
her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	8.485228538513184
charlotte is an
excellent manager, i dare say.	17.99647331237793
let me mend it for you.	16.0982666015625
he
drew a chair near her.	19.93934440612793
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	33.4478874206543
she had heard nothing of
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	24.940828323364258
he heard her attentively, and then said,

"lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."	22.7352294921875
you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing."	25.540382385253906
on this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	27.75750160217285
i could hardly keep my countenance.	18.29029083251953
her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh."	1.8288949728012085
his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	23.572017669677734
if your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning.	19.27912712097168
oh!	35.182037353515625
exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good.	23.220705032348633
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	20.460948944091797
he spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.	9.248627662658691
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to
wickham.	26.715036392211914
jane was by no means better.	20.676809310913086
no officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.	21.981706619262695
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	17.14052963256836
i do think mrs long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."	31.640478134155273
"indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	30.405961990356445
_they_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	37.38759231567383
we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way.	19.079862594604492
i should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire."	23.38858985900879
"if he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "i shall give him up for
ever."	14.86465835571289
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	17.919559478759766
her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire.	30.640270233154297
her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	39.65654754638672
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.	25.09238624572754
for
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	29.66380500793457
he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	15.960250854492188
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,

"lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe.	24.426828384399414
you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	22.491796493530273
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	33.654449462890625
from the entrance hall, of which mr collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine,
her daughter, and mrs jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	12.677325248718262
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	41.63065719604492
"thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	10.222412109375
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	22.035913467407227
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.	22.47073745727539
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.	19.944664001464844
when mrs bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	25.769731521606445
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	8.24738883972168
at least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."	68.20552825927734
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	20.939990997314453
pray do not talk of that odious man.	36.32442092895508
but with _me_, it is not so.	23.396230697631836
he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.	18.5562801361084
he looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at pemberley.	30.79671859741211
the former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	37.993160247802734
my temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."	34.24757766723633
but i will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	26.91550064086914
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield.	13.950004577636719
"his manners are very different from his cousin's."	24.273977279663086
upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	7.559623718261719
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	33.910465240478516
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	21.03524398803711
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	31.237882614135742
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for.	25.758981704711914
she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	56.41017532348633
"my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope to make you love me.	30.01758575439453
it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	17.658723831176758
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	10.711468696594238
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	43.96292495727539
he had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."	10.102581977844238
cried elizabeth.	29.669174194335938
on saturday he came again.	13.082441329956055
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate.	22.2869815826416
"miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that i am not to be trifled with.	26.59899139404297
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	8.42094898223877
but amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following,
     as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly
     went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference.	15.389896392822266
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	18.62933921813965
she was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	18.836387634277344
mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	20.460079193115234
she read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	18.354690551757812
in
talking over their route the evening before, mrs gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.	21.48113441467285
he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him."	25.963865280151367
her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	16.019916534423828
in
truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings."	13.075156211853027
and for _this_ we are to be
thankful.	37.76109313964844
every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	22.293210983276367
you need not.	18.069149017333984
"it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	18.0293025970459
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	17.509647369384766
said he; "that is rather singular."	10.285696983337402
she was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	23.727811813354492
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do, when i
tell you all."	29.051830291748047
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	26.147525787353516
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	24.78152847290039
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	14.995878219604492
"indeed!"	40.912235260009766
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	27.841602325439453
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	28.56123161315918
it was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	12.745768547058105
but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	41.13966751098633
then turning to mr bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	12.559845924377441
i thought i should have broke my heart."	28.967256546020508
when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	36.576663970947266
it is too long ago.	30.58692169189453
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	84.73886108398438
"my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."	23.019472122192383
"yes, or i will never see her again."	12.27783203125
her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	17.331287384033203
"i must ask whether you were surprised?"	18.63444709777832
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and
mrs collins well."	25.064727783203125
but make a virtue of it
by all means.	44.615684509277344
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know, and read great
books, and make extracts."	22.623199462890625
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	14.08280086517334
why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	24.971363067626953
- you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing or by e-mail within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg-tm
     license.	20.78215217590332
it is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.	28.520893096923828
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	38.0205192565918
she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	27.784912109375
elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	189.33787536621094
nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	19.965023040771484
what are men
to rocks and mountains?	22.48938751220703
"very, very much.	43.533695220947266
i am only ashamed of his asking so little."	20.97319793701172
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	29.073558807373047
jane was not happy.	25.233261108398438
let me advise you then, my dear sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.	31.37146759033203
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make _me_
happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."	34.47893142700195
"i am not now to learn," replied mr collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	30.171581268310547
he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."	29.242168426513672
"my dear jane!"	24.198261260986328
their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	16.6859188079834
not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	32.65577697753906
yet now i must believe you," cried
jane.	30.604755401611328
nothing could be more delightful!	20.958797454833984
"upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--pray, what is your age?"	24.8607120513916
"oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	26.921253204345703
"and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business."	31.782623291015625
having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	52.91817855834961
on this
subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left
hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'mr collins, you
must marry.	32.19427490234375
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of
short duration.	20.983205795288086
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs forster,
the delight of mrs bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
to be described.	17.29590606689453
it is from my cousin, mr collins, who, when i am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	19.857872009277344
"_you_ were mr bingley's first choice."	24.610715866088867
did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in kent?"	50.037315368652344
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin.	17.442747116088867
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	28.498863220214844
poor little lizzy!	20.247791290283203
the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
lydia's infamy somewhat better.	21.609169006347656
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	27.87765121459961
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when
he put his letter into her hand!	14.812664031982422
in a few minutes, mrs bennet half opened the door and called out,

"lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you."	41.349239349365234
not all that mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley.	29.97454833984375
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	13.264739990234375
"i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	23.873384475708008
you may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night.	10.852775573730469
"i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am
gone."	46.062740325927734
this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	22.03217887878418
but my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards miss king.	18.637832641601562
"you are joking, lizzy.	4.027275085449219
i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the
country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	15.056489944458008
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent.	39.356597900390625
it adds even another motive.	28.877771377563477
pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	28.46660041809082
"i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always speak
what i think."	78.51025390625
"i told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	13.042850494384766
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	82.7439956665039
"what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	15.006217956542969
with his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	19.7294921875
"very true; and if i had my will, we should.	18.03285026550293
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	33.00174331665039
it seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	27.301952362060547
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies.	33.788246154785156
i know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have
     still something more to ask of the former.	5.455756187438965
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	20.447484970092773
i am glad
he is gone.	27.400644302368164
mr bingley followed his advice.	13.7183198928833
but i
will not repine.	21.25084686279297
she longed to see mrs philips, the lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to mrs hill and the two housemaids.	66.68717193603516
mr bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	54.87664794921875
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	18.401517868041992
so much the man of fashion!	28.53410530090332
my dear charlotte,--impossible!"	34.98200988769531
"good gracious!"	17.47553062438965
elizabeth made no answer.	18.373754501342773
such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!	50.56028747558594
interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	32.577884674072266
not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive.	24.88677406311035
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months!	20.25263214111328
"what think you of books?"	11.477423667907715
"but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."	11.40682601928711
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.	16.123291015625
"very well.--that reply will do for the present.--perhaps by and bye i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--but _now_ we may be silent."	27.580564498901367
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	198.65377807617188
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	42.2232780456543
"well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	6.736170768737793
mr what's his name.	20.412893295288086
she knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.	15.25731086730957
i know we dine with four and twenty families."	17.05309295654297
she saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	17.056076049804688
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	10.0338773727417
no
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	16.966812133789062
colonel forster will, i dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	45.235591888427734
this matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."	39.05796813964844
mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.	15.618993759155273
"good heaven!	28.102928161621094
after sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth,

"i hope you are well, miss bennet.	45.26860046386719
her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	34.136837005615234
they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	46.127193450927734
when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	29.359004974365234
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.	39.97731399536133
it was to be such a secret!"	21.931066513061523
bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	22.717510223388672
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.	38.26298904418945
i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	16.29707908630371
while sir william was with them, mr collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	14.23962116241455
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	31.416736602783203
"his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.	15.035584449768066
i pity, though i
     cannot help blaming her.	22.713485717773438
that he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	34.038387298583984
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	23.894689559936523
i speak
feelingly.	6.741271018981934
"he
only told me, what i have now told you."	22.990739822387695
if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.	23.36724281311035
you shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	31.6604061126709
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about.	16.774494171142578
i will read it to you--

"when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	25.632556915283203
the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	28.320878982543945
"that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."	22.925378799438477
is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very
ill."

"no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	17.736461639404297
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	21.799821853637695
she had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr wickham
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows."	12.64999771118164
you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mother's permission for this address.	40.2313117980957
she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	22.345455169677734
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	22.539958953857422
"or in other words, you are determined to have him.	28.789159774780273
their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.	23.18694496154785
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and i know i appeared distressed.	27.314226150512695
you know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	27.731809616088867
yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."	28.156639099121094
jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	17.386110305786133
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	18.01978302001953
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?	21.720691680908203
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr philips's.	19.254533767700195
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment.	18.661867141723633
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.	14.049116134643555
to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained.	37.7568244934082
but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.	22.76523780822754
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham.	26.473634719848633
what are we to do!"	44.984317779541016
"what does mr darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?"	24.6846866607666
why any fear of detection?	28.456836700439453
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	6.730634689331055
you _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	8.557046890258789
he was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	14.018694877624512
"do you prefer reading to cards?"	13.318340301513672
then shewing
her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet.	14.154749870300293
as they passed through the hall,
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	13.717973709106445
"you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	17.773073196411133
you are lucky in
having such a master."	29.267229080200195
change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."	19.278032302856445
reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	11.850802421569824
_invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square._

_engraved for no.	46.321903228759766
mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	14.267523765563965
"we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	24.131866455078125
"there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	24.969181060791016
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely."	21.87113380432129
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,"
said mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, i shall have nothing to wish for."	22.393657684326172
mr gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was saturday.	23.4458065032959
mr wickham
had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	29.743589401245117
the sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	37.82673263549805
cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after mr and mrs gardiner.	36.12420654296875
not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	18.83820343017578
"an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	26.704809188842773
"you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."	27.551288604736328
to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	32.86322784423828
"i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."	24.852384567260742
however, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."	13.543991088867188
bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.	45.600311279296875
"your examination of mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss
bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	28.737028121948242
it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	43.283714294433594
he cannot know what mr
darcy is."	29.35348129272461
two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	26.522972106933594
he has given in all his debts; i hope
     at least he has not deceived us.	32.031341552734375
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	11.666093826293945
"oh!	9.614008903503418
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	31.781248092651367
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.	22.768787384033203
"take whatever you like, and get away."	32.33662796020508
"you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr darcy?"	30.212228775024414
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	13.773727416992188
i did not think mrs
gardiner was so little to be trusted."	16.020360946655273
"i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	23.637319564819336
she dared not
even mention that gentleman.	105.46444702148438
"we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	17.83397674560547
the vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr darcy could not have.	26.192602157592773
1.c.	24.08231544494629
mrs collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	7.292076587677002
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	11.30168342590332
i have not _that_ pain.	41.34014129638672
it is almost past belief.	19.161514282226562
you are so strange!	34.372154235839844
it was
the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	21.863677978515625
when this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	3.6869397163391113
perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice.	19.52718734741211
it has been my own doing,
and i ought to feel it."	11.332027435302734
"nearly three weeks."	28.419111251831055
i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his
regimentals."	29.953310012817383
did you see him while you were at lambton?	13.014025688171387
i
did not expect such a compliment."	21.304553985595703
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	39.44419860839844
to kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected.	22.582340240478516
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	10.735565185546875
well, i was so frightened i did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	1.8288949728012085
they had long wished to see him.	21.313810348510742
but it is so
strange!"	15.374580383300781
oh!	20.259050369262695
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	28.907400131225586
"i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	13.443525314331055
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr darcy.--_i_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."	11.382842063903809
heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	37.256099700927734
sir william did not say much.	41.81466293334961
he begged
pardon for having displeased her.	54.91549301147461
at that moment, she cared for no other.	14.263425827026367
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	17.332868576049805
i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.	23.231313705444336
i have suspected it some time, but
i am now convinced."	14.647059440612793
"i can easily believe it.	12.337075233459473
in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	21.464691162109375
she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	22.161863327026367
the effect was immediate.	26.27256202697754
"in what an amiable light does this place him!"	13.852849960327148
in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he
wants you in the library."	11.822954177856445
"well, lizzy," said mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of jane's?	25.032052993774414
my sole dependence was on you; and
i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	36.18922805786133
she wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	44.25056457519531
elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	29.19696807861328
not a soul knew of it, but col. and mrs
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	29.218090057373047
"what do you mean, mr bennet, by talking in this way?	26.946109771728516
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
case?"	31.852773666381836
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.	33.143470764160156
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	19.01266860961914
"true," said mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."	15.19009780883789
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on.	19.781545639038086
it is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	8.000869750976562
georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	24.777315139770508
it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.	30.696956634521484
"and mary king is safe!"	10.928313255310059
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done.	8.880138397216797
a few weeks, he believed.	15.939309120178223
the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	30.25196647644043
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."	21.554363250732422
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.	34.88272476196289
at length darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."	27.02381706237793
no."	6.215805530548096
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."	24.68777847290039
she followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!	40.34226608276367
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.	21.384021759033203
i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	22.2996883392334
your's, &c."

mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what mr bennet sent to mr collins, in
reply to his last.	19.361413955688477
as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	20.46419334411621
they were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	20.751380920410156
we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."	117.36780548095703
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; mr bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
fixed for the following tuesday.	27.40933609008789
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy.	18.4502010345459
it is unaccountable!	20.37928009033203
she shall hear my opinion."	28.595867156982422
kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	22.283985137939453
she wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false!	68.4282455444336
charlotte did not stay much
longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	35.72456359863281
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to mr bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	10.69709587097168
but that is nothing to us.	20.332937240600586
"what do you think?	14.694287300109863
such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	1.8288949728012085
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was
shocked.	17.748666763305664
you
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be.	30.594501495361328
oh!	22.133638381958008
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
about this report?	28.3975887298584
she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.	13.830586433410645
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.	18.287405014038086
"there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.	5.3435468673706055
i do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy."	23.157936096191406
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's
visit.	51.47134780883789
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered.	18.062253952026367
her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	34.04835510253906
the carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	44.011627197265625
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town
next saturday."	7.926328659057617
his father, miss bennet, the late mr darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	18.062179565429688
the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, mr bingley?"	8.233223915100098
never mind miss
lizzy's hair."	34.40403747558594
it had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	25.223875045776367
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	19.983076095581055
"i am not one and twenty."	19.670190811157227
very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	38.179725646972656
"i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	21.60429573059082
on the very day of my coming
     home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	20.065261840820312
"i am afraid, mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."	25.00921630859375
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity.	18.954572677612305
catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to london.	30.054540634155273
my sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel
     fitzwilliam, and myself.	35.294212341308594
they
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	19.5369815826416
"i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel
millar's regiment went away.	86.01011657714844
"why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"	38.391571044921875
oh, no."	25.15414047241211
there's for you!	42.13468933105469
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	16.73737335205078
but now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage.	26.522972106933594
the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	12.45748233795166
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn.	15.244013786315918
"oh!	21.828161239624023
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	24.663745880126953
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	16.404882431030273
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.	20.291065216064453
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	17.81562042236328
not that _i_ think
charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."	18.553285598754883
she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	20.39707374572754
he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley's salutation.	15.962583541870117
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	34.66820526123047
the advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	22.24030876159668
and her neighbours at
lucas lodge, therefore, for through their communication with the
collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	25.176504135131836
it would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	20.262142181396484
"when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	32.12844467163086
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	43.35799026489258
my feelings in every respect
forbid it.	24.542400360107422
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	8.940180778503418
"yes, and i had heard it before.	14.407360076904297
would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	11.464274406433105
yes, yes.	16.401742935180664
jane now came up.	27.554134368896484
not these two or three years perhaps."	13.800990104675293
bingley met them with hopes
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.	18.899105072021484
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	27.615114212036133
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia,
assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn.	19.374080657958984
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	15.705117225646973
"if i were as rich as mr darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his
sisters, "i should not care how proud i was.	20.141504287719727
_he_ was
     exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
     would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter
     last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain.	34.928611755371094
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	17.9296932220459
much as i abominate
writing, i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any
consideration.	27.228931427001953
"_i_ never saw such a woman.	48.9849853515625
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	39.2328987121582
you must send john with
the young ladies, mrs collins.	20.44289779663086
they are
wanted in the farm, mr bennet, are not they?"	18.503355026245117
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	13.165462493896484
"and what is fifty miles of good road?	23.540781021118164
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?"	21.201873779296875
but i dare not
hope it.	19.3767032623291
"in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	7.271925926208496
when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	31.552534103393555
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	13.105565071105957
"your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	19.989585876464844
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.	23.31129264831543
her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	16.623672485351562
be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	13.437677383422852
mr
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	27.662939071655273
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to.	19.719518661499023
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	14.480020523071289
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i
     laugh.	28.981609344482422
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.	18.503446578979492
--

"my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	20.18386459350586
elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	44.01569747924805
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, mr darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."	33.4120979309082
darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.	17.973995208740234
two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	31.803987503051758
family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	20.793312072753906
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	28.213661193847656
mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	20.886520385742188
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	40.483707427978516
"can it be
possible that he will marry her?"	15.262822151184082
that lady i suppose is your mother."	17.882429122924805
but, lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	19.642244338989258
said elizabeth.	21.640037536621094
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.	17.270477294921875
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	30.234907150268555
"two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	14.055156707763672
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's."	2.7592029571533203
ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	21.50423240661621
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."	14.058485984802246
"because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	310.0595703125
"whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes.	27.31136703491211
had he done his duty in that
respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	14.37442398071289
'ah!	23.392471313476562
while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	21.913171768188477
my youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who i believe will soon become a part of the family."	24.349637985229492
"much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."	33.354209899902344
she was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.	21.1657772064209
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"	20.58346176147461
mamma would like to
go too of all things!	16.27843475341797
"oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
scotland."	27.915328979492188
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--mr collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	24.245851516723633
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	35.571388244628906
"which do you mean?"	20.53697395324707
it
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	7.290321350097656
"he is as fine a fellow," said mr bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever i saw.	9.68118667602539
that is the place to get
husbands.	28.847692489624023
mrs
reynolds could interest her on no other point.	11.777494430541992
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	16.595603942871094
it originated in
mrs gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	12.302593231201172
she directly replied,

"you need not be frightened.	30.819557189941406
"you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with cold civility,
"that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."	28.971364974975586
"let me be rightly understood.	21.60265350341797
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	29.234514236450195
with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	87.12540435791016
you know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	22.377134323120117
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance."	59.91580581665039
"yes, all of them, i think.	10.287006378173828
while
there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	25.7429256439209
she cried.	12.2035551071167
but don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.	25.607603073120117
haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week.	24.947965621948242
to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	15.611785888671875
by tea-time however the dose had been enough, and mr bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	22.873668670654297
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	14.908975601196289
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	33.28954315185547
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	40.82102584838867
they
are my old friends.	34.4879264831543
"it may do very well for the others," replied mr bingley; "but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty.	21.20071029663086
my avowed one, or what i avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made."	17.63838005065918
have you never
happened to see her there?"	22.593046188354492
his character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr
darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	20.80428695678711
mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.	26.43088722229004
a promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	15.690873146057129
she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	54.11326599121094
miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy.	18.47267723083496
i have a high respect for your nerves.	19.538196563720703
"with the officers!"	23.701990127563477
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving
home.	30.76730728149414
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	25.782106399536133
"he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	50.360809326171875
"i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage.	14.909157752990723
the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.	20.697986602783203
"i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him.	26.557769775390625
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	22.322521209716797
but pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	28.278743743896484
were it known to the rest
of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	13.98039436340332
but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.	37.536319732666016
her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	20.22804069519043
there is nothing else to be done.	12.473773002624512
in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	21.85359764099121
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh
looked that way.	31.33294677734375
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.	29.50861358642578
she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"is your sister at pemberley still?"	25.170873641967773
i am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	13.020322799682617
and his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	36.6923713684082
she respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	30.392234802246094
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	14.71329402923584
"when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and
when i am in town it is pretty much the same.	12.322867393493652
"i am all astonishment.	24.66748046875
i longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	24.589168548583984
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	16.267179489135742
if i wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	9.59760856628418
i do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	20.612417221069336
"let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."	19.863422393798828
unless the elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	14.877617835998535
and then we were so merry all the way home!	45.03773880004883
*       *       *       *       *

in the evening, soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	39.01776885986328
with a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at netherfield.	27.85657501220703
he still loves me, and we are
engaged."	16.992578506469727
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	18.031383514404297
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	14.052469253540039
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	17.453807830810547
it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	16.46651840209961
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at
present i have not room to do them justice."	12.037158966064453
he did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	14.427302360534668
"it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	25.089298248291016
charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley."	22.187864303588867
she had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	27.060914993286133
he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."	12.704655647277832
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	36.36928176879883
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	27.456710815429688
"you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan."	26.48938751220703
but i was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	19.996458053588867
said she.	32.330142974853516
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.	23.492429733276367
bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	26.702009201049805
jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.	30.55866241455078
after sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london,
mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	20.13144302368164
"he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	38.63453674316406
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	26.9931697845459
there are few people
whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.	38.3538703918457
painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	24.065807342529297
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	46.250858306884766
and so
she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	27.846952438354492
i told mrs collins so before you came.	33.67014694213867
"nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth.	10.323113441467285
i have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	26.899555206298828
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day.	26.90997314453125
"i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	38.781524658203125
but on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	15.13428783416748
"my dear brother,

     "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction.	65.24231719970703
"you know nothing of the matter.	33.898643493652344
you must contrive to send
somebody.	10.76075267791748
"are you, indeed?	19.669857025146484
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	31.621959686279297
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	25.33319854736328
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world!	47.52621078491211
they were hopeless of remedy.	37.52045822143555
"when you have killed all your own birds, mr bingley," said her mother,
"i beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on mr
bennet's manor.	15.026283264160156
mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	43.046871185302734
i perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	9.395228385925293
"i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	32.283443450927734
but i will no longer importune my young cousin."	11.521573066711426
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	12.145021438598633
"will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"	26.609113693237305
mr darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	19.328168869018555
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.	27.081783294677734
but however he did not.	20.061813354492188
i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	30.9572696685791
to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	16.81189727783203
yet he knew to the contrary himself.	15.782490730285645
she could
think of nothing but of mr wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent.	38.207801818847656
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	24.43907928466797
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.	72.54609680175781
he must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.	17.089950561523438
with a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	35.55562973022461
and pray what sort of guardians do you make?	31.648082733154297
"i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	13.205327033996582
"i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	20.770898818969727
i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	14.759699821472168
though lydia's short
     letter to mrs f. gave them to understand that they were going to
     gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief
     that w. never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which
     was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from b. intending to trace their route.	12.089106559753418
regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and mrs younge was of course removed from
     her charge.	23.658985137939453
this room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	11.152283668518066
we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	17.414308547973633
his choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing.	22.419639587402344
her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	27.54041862487793
sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know
that mr collins wants to marry lizzy?"	31.233959197998047
wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.	23.930063247680664
is this to be endured!	17.742733001708984
lizzy, to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family!	19.645709991455078
"there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow
me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton?"	13.492722511291504
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	31.933542251586914
"i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.	17.895519256591797
i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	297.45697021484375
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	19.86429786682129
she dared not relate the other
half of mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	17.10381507873535
she repeated.	25.727096557617188
she was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	16.663177490234375
i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	25.38641929626465
"that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs bennet, "and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	20.518699645996094
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
bingley.	32.40483093261719
but she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.	14.551916122436523
such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	20.33362579345703
"but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."	34.74217987060547
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."	15.76675033569336
the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.	36.98929977416992
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	67.11378479003906
"i never heard any thing so
abominable.	23.737585067749023
the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	43.43203353881836
"but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for.	13.852211952209473
are quite well."	13.731132507324219
the
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	4.2569899559021
bingley was by no means deficient,
but darcy was clever.	15.86884593963623
i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn."	7.916641712188721
its completion depended on others.	13.206804275512695
and she was only sixteen last june.	17.076374053955078
- you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of project gutenberg-tm works.	9.493569374084473

"i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if _i_
should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia."	17.31673240661621
how thankful am i,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves.	11.44023323059082
and as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	35.75836181640625
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	18.040185928344727
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	16.38802146911621
she is grown so brown and coarse!	13.244632720947266
*       *       *       *       *

it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.	12.17634391784668
in society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	12.339055061340332
but mrs bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	26.784828186035156
he begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any
message to her.	22.43480110168457
what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	11.984280586242676
has she any family?"	15.483843803405762
"i am astonished, my dear," said mrs bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	3.099364757537842
lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.	36.76350402832031
it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	60.0135383605957
her report was highly favourable.	20.915672302246094
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil?	27.884037017822266
"i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	21.611831665039062
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	25.281719207763672
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.	12.538623809814453
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except mary agreed to go with her; and mr collins was to attend them,
at the request of mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither mr collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.	13.812508583068848
he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.	12.712973594665527
the
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."	35.47419738769531
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr darcy, who sat opposite to them.	35.20277404785156
he
comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday.	18.170303344726562
"and do you like her?"	24.370807647705078
it amazes
me, i confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.	10.34850788116455
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	26.522972106933594
she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	12.222623825073242
this was invitation enough.	89.26862335205078
"oh!	24.33492660522461
"yet why did he come?"	11.784399032592773
when is your turn to come?	21.3378849029541
mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!	50.73265075683594
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.	30.241775512695312
they met again on sunday, and
     then _i_ saw him too.	29.45484161376953
"tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	15.250170707702637
but the case is
this.	32.47122573852539
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.	4.65913724899292
on being made acquainted with the
present mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	12.009968757629395
in anticipating the happiness of bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	15.714463233947754
it will save me a world of trouble
and economy.	19.2335205078125
mr darcy walked off; and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	21.82577133178711
but however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	28.192716598510742
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley's."	20.59078025817871
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.	13.547459602355957
as for
their mother, mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.	81.61809539794922
"pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried mr collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	37.058837890625
in spite of having been at st. james's, sir william was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	18.822853088378906
"in essentials, i believe, he is very much
what he ever was."	21.567890167236328
how rich
and how great you will be!	12.418594360351562
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	12.133520126342773
to be sure london was
rather thin, but however the little theatre was open.	17.060462951660156
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster's.	22.935596466064453
"oh!"	12.63288402557373
it is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like."	18.017066955566406
they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	19.231388092041016
miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	31.602022171020508
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	19.573389053344727
on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	32.957881927490234
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	13.206804275512695
it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	2.2647650241851807
but i suppose you had no opportunity.	16.09600257873535
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	18.101665496826172
good bye.	9.35233211517334
she smiled, but made no answer.	10.410318374633789
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project
gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.	35.751678466796875
besides, there was truth in his
looks."	15.172950744628906
"that is not very likely; our authority was too good."	11.492778778076172
yes;--there is nothing in that.	13.073473930358887
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	20.215261459350586
four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.	14.828303337097168
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	31.59343910217285
and is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	20.728477478027344
jane was distressed.	26.143966674804688
darcy, after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	31.196569442749023
miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	19.311742782592773
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	32.24775695800781
"she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	20.952617645263672
_you_ cannot have
been always at longbourn."	8.99758243560791
by all that i have
ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	30.89599609375
elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.	15.845799446105957
every body is disgusted with his pride.	23.509340286254883
it is mr bingley
i am sure.	99.68606567382812
1813.	26.73459243774414
my friend has an excellent understanding--though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	19.814485549926758
surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.	37.697513580322266
she had very little notice from any but him.	6.0034565925598145
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	22.511747360229492
but perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	9.596921920776367
said he,
as he joined her.	39.44490432739258
mr bennet protested against any
description of finery.	16.304729461669922
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	23.42630958557129
we must not
all expect jane's good fortune."	8.568384170532227
"we
can all plague and punish one another.	32.531959533691406
the comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	21.668577194213867
here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	16.462820053100586
if _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"	15.049976348876953
and _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	13.987140655517578
elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	64.9191665649414
not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
i know are all chance in this world.	42.668983459472656
the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	45.65314865112305
but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for mrs bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	13.738870620727539
"how good it was in you, my dear mr bennet!	22.15980339050293
she
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.	35.80654525756836
letters of business too!	24.584184646606445
well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	23.167064666748047
will you be very angry with me, my dear
     lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
     enough to say before how much i like him.	12.466591835021973
"and pray
may i ask?"	47.91352462768555
she will be down in a moment i dare say."	31.443466186523438
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	16.600208282470703
"and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."	34.72051239013672
i cannot think so very ill of
wickham.	19.47989273071289
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	3.250308036804199
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	25.358016967773438
"well, well, and so mr bingley is coming down, sister," for mrs
philips first brought her the news.	15.661660194396973
and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.	18.922889709472656
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	19.17462921142578
"i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions."	20.34525489807129
charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	19.756855010986328
it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say
nothing of that.	32.99153137207031
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	39.742549896240234
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	17.197011947631836
"i will make no promise of the kind."	17.332704544067383
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton.	16.03290557861328
the next was in these words.	38.38163375854492
the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	31.67593765258789
when they repaired to the
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	44.440589904785156
repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."	22.350318908691406
"i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	22.36018943786621
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!	27.39228057861328
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire.	8.273845672607422
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg:

1.e.1.	6.512777328491211
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.	9.277120590209961
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.	26.704116821289062
"do you certainly leave kent on saturday?"	25.2268123626709
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	39.37806701660156
mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	10.934724807739258
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	21.409299850463867
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	52.7009391784668
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."	47.55827331542969
the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her.	15.26215648651123
"oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	6.641286373138428
it was very little less.	21.96061897277832
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	13.464247703552246
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	14.8281831741333
my mind was more
agreeably engaged.	39.0422248840332
well, any friend of
mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him."	34.096065521240234
you do not know what i suffer."	15.234959602355957
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to rosings.	50.28216552734375
"now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	35.45467758178711
jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.	105.46444702148438
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel
fitzwilliam.	61.51463317871094
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	18.588443756103516
"yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation!	44.2226448059082
1.f.	59.71817398071289
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets.	28.374919891357422
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	3.9301187992095947
they are all for what they can get.	7.011292457580566
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	23.028596878051758
the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty.	7.750361442565918
_they_ will never be distressed
for money.	17.264972686767578
"yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	22.297536849975586
"yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	12.948899269104004
"good god!	13.58261775970459
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.	26.84945297241211
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	19.352256774902344
anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	13.111597061157227
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	26.522972106933594
they
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	19.959138870239258
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."	10.412277221679688
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in
vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	34.41990280151367
"oh!	23.01247215270996
in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	18.88656234741211
how acutely did she now
feel it.	22.94405746459961
"my dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	4.230860233306885
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	26.506582260131836
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what
i learnt, to my own family!	28.280193328857422
he knows of my
     being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy.	25.984642028808594
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	22.07992172241211
mrs bennet's best
comfort was, that mr bingley must be down again in the summer.	7.571280002593994
i cannot do justice to his kindness.	32.34183120727539
the death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	31.699357986450195
"i hope," added mrs gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.	18.42723274230957
i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."	6.994071960449219
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth.	84.45723724365234
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	19.67486000061035
"i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	10.98670768737793
accompanied by a violent yawn.	22.0651798248291
but what is that to me?	8.76437759399414
she approached, and saw
the likeness of mr wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	24.525741577148438
"can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?"	35.69109344482422
but as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	19.844459533691406
his disposition must
be dreadful."	18.14359474182129
elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	25.730173110961914
"wickham so
very bad!	38.47834014892578
he then handed her
in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.	25.37419319152832
i have told miss bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often
told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
mrs jenkinson's room.	30.4757022857666
"but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.	16.148670196533203
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	32.483158111572266
"your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr darcy."	21.442779541015625
"i have said no such thing.	32.94499588012695
elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.	10.632179260253906
i could not have parted with
you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy."	29.67552375793457
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	9.102046012878418
"he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."	12.534619331359863

but to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character!	19.474079132080078
how odious i should think them!"	11.412214279174805
good girl!	32.45500183105469
this
however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	18.731609344482422
he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	44.5941276550293
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	40.51893615722656
if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long.	12.689042091369629
"i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."	23.614200592041016
"he brought it with him for us to see."	38.92893981933594

the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s
regiment."	22.577177047729492
they were natural and just.	12.037566184997559
"yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	43.67592239379883
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in
address that he improves?	32.92002868652344
she was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
     herself.	29.010446548461914
this will never do."	22.13327407836914
and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road."	19.44377326965332
but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	54.74262237548828
"i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on, than
that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it
be not so, let mr darcy contradict it.	21.188154220581055
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	15.98586654663086
i can recal nothing worse.	26.936861038208008
said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
youngest, i'm the tallest."	13.869706153869629
what is the matter?"	18.99831771850586
his letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.	14.000314712524414
i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."	18.656415939331055
mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.	10.744029998779297
"i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."	29.865678787231445
but the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.	20.955108642578125
"you may well warn me against such an evil.	10.797026634216309
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	22.729206085205078
"pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing i believe.	12.947979927062988
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to london, before they procured lodgings.	17.60498809814453
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr
wickham's attentions.	17.50278091430664
the second began.	15.41085147857666
the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	10.006723403930664
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.	26.873668670654297
her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	23.706838607788086
"that is a question which mr darcy only can answer."	18.014060974121094
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	38.67594909667969
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	9.946338653564453
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	25.860265731811523
the
housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	22.329025268554688
"but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	27.595932006835938
"you are uniformly charming!"	30.745506286621094
as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	23.912914276123047
"_that_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness!	41.26510238647461
one may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	27.553110122680664
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.	8.315134048461914
why is not every body as happy?"	9.535048484802246
--and then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	17.998733520507812
she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.	10.552855491638184
what did colonel
forster say?	26.522972106933594
her ease and good
spirits increased.	2.8868067264556885
they must be a great loss to _your_ family."	14.684788703918457
she is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished.	3.174753189086914
"oh!	59.208160400390625
both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	38.485599517822266
at that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	22.332292556762695
we neither of us perform to strangers."	22.914148330688477
"all!--what, all five out at once?	28.361461639404297
she added, "by far too much.	43.41233444213867
when mr
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte.	20.793075561523438
it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them
     both----"

"then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!"	23.68722915649414
for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions.	15.728687286376953
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?"	15.749629974365234
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
manner:--

"you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	51.43754959106445
"i wish it may."	79.2598876953125
the
gentlemen did approach; and when mr wickham walked into the room,
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	7.690006256103516
these are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as i thought myself privileged, for you.	28.878496170043945
mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	22.146474838256836
well, well, i only hope it
will last.	15.919499397277832
till i
can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_."	23.969480514526367
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found.	32.068973541259766
i must find mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; i have not an instant to lose."	27.996463775634766
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
openly.	14.583789825439453
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	19.703195571899414
oh, brother,
how kind you are!	20.202035903930664
"yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be.	22.682937622070312
mr collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day.	18.292306900024414
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care.	31.985050201416016
i
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	27.791841506958008
"i am, dear sir, &c. &c."

mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	10.508976936340332
can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	16.696603775024414
"it is _not_ mr bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life."	23.352224349975586
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much.	26.73459243774414
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.	33.675811767578125
had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	16.50779151916504
"my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which

since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	18.58299446105957
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."	23.169471740722656

he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	16.409021377563477

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	43.34487533569336
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.	18.22732162475586
