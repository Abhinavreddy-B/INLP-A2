their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen
would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of

versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was
rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,
bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future
as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid
at skerries, or malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or
jealousy, pure and simple.	111.62644958496094

on this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference
in their respective ages, clashed.	1239.538330078125

unmack i have it.	1820.1258544921875
it is between the

which her four bones are not to be laid.	101.24089050292969
stephen: how is that?	2691.52294921875
what rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate
purchase?	3173.975830078125
but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him.	1817.0447998046875
and her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home.	1209.01513671875
she felt a kind of a
sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on
because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of
the moon.	494.5077209472656

wagnerian music, though
confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to
follow at the first go-off but the music of mercadante’s _huguenots_,
meyerbeer’s _seven last words on the cross_ and mozart’s _twelfth mass_
he simply revelled in, the _gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the
acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else
into a cocked hat.	586.3532104492188

the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final
floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were
present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,
escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the ballast office and
custom house were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical
power station at the pigeonhouse and the poolbeg light.	2802.314453125
an outlandish delegate sustained against
both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the
theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his

yes, pious had told
him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason
was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing
exterior whose name, she said, is bird-in-the-hand and she beguiled him
wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,
ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and i will show you a brave
place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot
which is named two-in-the-bush or, by some learned, carnal

yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his
bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it
while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for
a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage
of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a
party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of
the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,
after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with
the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched, inflicted
fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was
reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of
fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	186.14239501953125

that it was a utopia, there being no known method from the
known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the

for one thing he mightn’t
what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried
him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,
supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very
great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in
his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	1298.56298828125

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90

wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	3677.753173828125

winding of his ticker.	2625.48046875
still, he’s the best of that lot.	672.982421875

their conversation accordingly
became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	4331.60498046875
breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk.	117.68708038330078
that likes me well.	646.7402954101562
let off steam.	1290.9013671875
about us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets.	4104.07861328125
he whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and
laughs kindly.	162.4048309326172
he heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	853.2894287109375
o, rocks!	369.005615234375

so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
watchchain, looking up at the church.	1423.657470703125
virag reaches the door in two
ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the

almost taste them by looking.	550.00927734375
mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
private account while dublin slept.	435.7392578125

that voice was a lamentation.	2645.52734375

mouth fallen open.	3351.958251953125
hands felt for the opulent.	133.38174438476562
one rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock paul de

what swells him up that way?	370.13116455078125
no, says joe.	2516.342041015625
after
completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the
implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the
corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	1765.3466796875

stephen: _pas seul!_

he wheels kitty into lynch’s arms, snatches up his ashplant from the
table and takes the floor.	94.02901458740234
mr dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at ned lambert’s quizzing
face, asked of it sourly:

i was in the red sea.	6435.51123046875
where old mrs riordan died.	208.1178741455078
drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
braided drums.	1203.628173828125
come, kinch.	5122.974609375
the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	2157.911376953125
what advance on two bob, gentlemen?	2740.103515625
it was he
who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him
because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.	496.936279296875
anyhow he
was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and
disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	728.871826171875

the sky showed him a flock of

then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:

the royal reader.	4677.22998046875
bloom stands aside.	247.6648406982422
the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge
by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about
saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to
himself allowed matters to more or less.	1247.25244140625

in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	1094.3399658203125

resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the

the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its

his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:

stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	1052.8570556640625
influential friends.	205.65206909179688
in vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through trinity gates.	613.2901000976562
does
anybody really?	748.7529296875
that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as plato’s.	161.03445434570312
holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is
landed.	1329.7506103515625
he provokes my intelligence.	168.7053680419922
he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,

stephen: panting.	673.2630004882812

a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	866.5614013671875

black church.	2054.664306640625
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	2981.38427734375
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	2.9420363903045654

the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words

prince hamlet’s twin, is it possible, i want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?	7647.119140625
certainly, i
sort of believe strong in you, mr president.	112.82195281982422

he closed my carriage door outside sir thornley stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	874.5911254882812
why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
