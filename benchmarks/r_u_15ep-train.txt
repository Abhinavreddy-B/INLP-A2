inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent

render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil
inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:

age bloom would be 54. in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen
would be 38, as bloom then was, bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of

he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a
versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was
rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,
bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future
as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid
at skerries, or malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or
jealousy, pure and simple.	63.1284294128418

stephen: how is that?	13290.8876953125
what rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate
purchase?	7403.78125
but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
like that from everyone always petting him.	2522.845703125
and her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home.	3441.32861328125
she felt a kind of a
sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on
because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of
the moon.	455.4549865722656

wagnerian music, though
confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to
follow at the first go-off but the music of mercadante’s _huguenots_,
meyerbeer’s _seven last words on the cross_ and mozart’s _twelfth mass_
he simply revelled in, the _gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the
acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else
into a cocked hat.	2097.5

because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o’hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti

asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she

struck him that fitz, nicknamed skin-the-goat, merely drove the car for
the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was
reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of
fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	322.27783203125

distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of
arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of orion with belt and
sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could
be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in
1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules: of
the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality
evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote
futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of
allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	0.0

its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of mercator’s
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the
pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the
independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its
hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and
spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the
circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial
significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the
globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all
the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn: the
multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its
capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances
including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow
erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of
homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its
alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of
colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular
ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent
oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,
gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in
seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs
and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric
instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of
its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent
part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the
dead sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies,
inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as
paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain,
sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms
in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls
and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries
and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its
docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric
power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in
canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its
potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic,
photophobe, numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the
globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90
% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine

pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning

saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging
around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the

press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
infatuation proved up to the hilt.	4972.8447265625

breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little

he heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,

mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the

was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own

mr dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at ned lambert’s quizzing

it was he

the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
friendliness which he gave at stephen’s at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge
by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about
saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to
himself allowed matters to more or less.	1000.9031372070312

the preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed
intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion
between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and
the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously
inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the
variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by
inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite
proposition parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic
transitive verb with direct feminine object from the active voice into
its correlative aorist preterite proposition parsed as feminine
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past
participle with complementary masculine agent in the passive voice:
the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual
production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest
or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of
nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	779.2113647460938

subsist otherwise under martian, mercurial, veneral, jovian, saturnian,
neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an
apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite

copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
trend of modern opinion a partiality, however, which, realising his
mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted
with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan’s so that
he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
metaphorically one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	532.1495971679688

resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten
inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in
space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in
preparation for the impact of the fall.	306.9021911621094

stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	2880.802490234375
influential friends.	2395.508056640625
in vain he trotted,
signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
implements of music through trinity gates.	935.4415283203125
does
anybody really?	221.35069274902344
that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as plato’s.	839.8292236328125
holy wars, says joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old shylock is
landed.	3664.822998046875
he provokes my intelligence.	438.9179382324219
he slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
stop: four.	796.4515380859375
stephen: panting.	310.4759216308594

the lord
mayor was there, val dillon it was, and sir charles cameron and dan
dawson spoke and there was music.	354.0673828125
mrs breen: she did, of course, the cat!	169.45887756347656
too much for me now.	1857.256103515625
we’ll manure you, mr flower!	6903.6572265625
go home to nicey bread and milky and say night
prayers with the kiddies.	1192.361083984375
a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute: the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	299.5888977050781
the fire brigade: pflaap!	4230.0654296875

the colours were done something lovely.	223.46568298339844

he boomed.	4759.5703125
he went through a form
of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
black church.	2877.803955078125
on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers.	8657.5234375
he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his bench.	6.1326422691345215
short but to the point


whose land?	228.8829803466797
if you.	171.9384765625
o, that be damned for a story, mr dedalus said.	1435.2344970703125
the best death, mr bloom said.	2239.970947265625
for such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve.	69.08204650878906
stephen: he had three brothers, gilbert, edmund, richard.	560.9716796875
paddy leonard asked.	517.5217895507812

astronomy it was about.	25.948036193847656
are you off?	681.5247802734375
poor dignam!	5144.81640625
let us go round by the chief’s grave, hynes said.	1597.433349609375
is it possible that that player shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been
prince hamlet’s twin, is it possible, i want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: i am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, ann shakespeare, born hathaway?	1734.6318359375
certainly, i
sort of believe strong in you, mr president.	275.01995849609375

because
he closed my carriage door outside sir thornley stoker’s one sleety day
during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the
wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	3625.904296875
why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a
hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s
daughter?	326.3835144042969

she often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in walker’s
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant.	2704.37353515625
for the
rest there is that english invention, pamphlet of which i received some
days ago, incorrectly addressed.	1437.398681640625
a stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by
daly’s window where a mermaid hair all streaming but he couldn’t see
blew whiffs of a mermaid blind couldn’t, mermaid, coolest whiff of
all.	1929.883056640625
will someone tell me where i am least
likely to meet these necessary evils?	897.173828125
amused buck mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
selfnodding:

a pleased bottom.	347.67822265625
i thought we

he halted near his daughter.	130.9440460205078

that once did starve us all.	262.4679260253906
i didn’t recognise him for the moment.	1105.352783203125

we’re on the right lay,

chords:

_when love absorbs my ardent soul_.	37.56867599487305
he has revealed it
in the sonnets where there is will in overplus.	349.5634765625
that’s all right.	353.3175964355469
of a different order of difficulty.	3819.32666015625
that’s in their
theology or the priest won’t give the poor woman the confession, the
absolution.	181.57992553710938
mr bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,
though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his
_protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in
the street which was still raging fast and furious:

a beautiful language.	2545.22119140625
yes, he does.	1507.8548583984375
so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
hear him lapping it up a mile off.	587.1589965820312
and a third, stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	3116.411376953125
is that a fact?	11300.4931640625
bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration.	2061.156494140625

he bore in his hand with
grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.	5278.81494140625
a moonlit nightcall: far, far.	1309.6790771484375
at last they were
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips.	3305.083984375

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._
