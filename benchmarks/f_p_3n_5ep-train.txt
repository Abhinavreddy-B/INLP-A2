61.52162551879883
her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered?	79.32544708251953
"indeed!"	29.154027938842773
miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	49.89363479614258
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	51.648677825927734
"i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	40.39750289916992
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for mrs bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	61.30134582519531
i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading!	78.79965209960938
to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.	59.55025863647461
resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i
trust i am resigned.	61.20744323730469
i am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	84.78145599365234
does your
charge give you much trouble?	56.203758239746094
"i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth.	136.7077178955078
"i beg your pardon.	18.729290008544922
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	71.74913024902344
"oh, yes!	98.93917846679688
it only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	54.64391326904297
he studies too much for
words of four syllables.--do not you, darcy?"	80.49557495117188
they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	92.81272888183594
miss
bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	44.01457595825195
i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	62.30628967285156
oh, sister!	49.36318588256836
kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do.	82.38557434082031
"it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."	50.768863677978516
"if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	61.89976501464844
she shook her head.	18.715164184570312
in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the
minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	65.84440612792969
bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	35.876914978027344
mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	47.56462478637695
"this is
wholly unexpected.	88.0918197631836
"gracechurch-street, monday,

     august 2.	54.036834716796875
she answered him with cold civility.	61.40327072143555
but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."	62.20862579345703
at present we
have nothing to guide us.	59.25575637817383
his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.	69.69567108154297
"my dear mr bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last?"	33.52549362182617
mr
collins then returned to elizabeth.	24.82940673828125
make
haste, and come down this moment."	71.95167541503906
but he found, in reply to
     this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	81.47348022460938
dear me!	49.383636474609375
allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."	45.49134063720703
i hope she will turn out well."	38.463680267333984
of course, we hope that you will support the project
gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.	46.458003997802734
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master.	54.49641036987305
it was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.	65.65109252929688
mrs reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	51.26963806152344
she looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest mary should be singing all night.	114.6924057006836
have you had any
flirting?	50.99142837524414
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	43.35434341430664
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has
too much truth.	55.79345703125
when all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish.	55.27375030517578
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	50.82832717895508
but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	53.891822814941406
consider how important every moment is, in such a case."	64.24592590332031
my father and mother believe the worst,
     but i cannot think so ill of him.	61.59220886230469
"how abominable!--i wonder that the very
pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty i must call it."	52.72659683227539
there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.	48.96647644042969
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	50.673866271972656
well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley.--but--good
lord!	36.85813522338867
my aunt philips came to longbourn
on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me.	54.758785247802734
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede.	55.12879180908203
miss darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	68.84727478027344
the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	63.758907318115234
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	60.17641830444336
"and _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london!	72.32218170166016
all was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	29.126310348510742
my dear charles, what do you mean?"	79.22542572021484
nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight.	59.282264709472656
what i have to say relates to
     poor lydia.	30.73664665222168
he does not
want abilities.	55.07062911987305
"you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	56.2364616394043
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	64.07209014892578
her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	60.45222473144531
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let mr collins and me have a little conversation together."	55.557865142822266
stay, stay, i will go myself.	124.19225311279297
"ah!	91.10645294189453
"and how impossible in others!"	47.10051727294922
it must be my uncle's doings!	53.56468963623047
with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	35.25946044921875
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy."	55.437400817871094
he had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--but bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point.	62.32685852050781
"i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing.	36.56147003173828
i am
perfectly satisfied.	62.65451431274414
he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	49.75006103515625
1.e.	62.676204681396484
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	54.689605712890625
his principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.	64.82982635498047
their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	51.94896697998047
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."	31.647602081298828
"dining out," said mrs bennet, "that is very unlucky."	54.8935546875
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	61.821712493896484
it was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	35.2664680480957
yes--i understand you perfectly."	49.75006103515625
1.e.5.	54.3238639831543
yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.	24.682777404785156
with _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."	40.17856216430664
"yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word."	38.90409851074219
"well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	31.250152587890625
you alluded to something else.	39.875179290771484
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	82.42108917236328
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	49.872314453125
"no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	67.70369720458984
he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	25.35080337524414
_she_ will not be able to help calling."	77.21265411376953
nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure and i do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it, your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	61.49123001098633
she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	43.87145233154297
she replied in the affirmative.	68.24540710449219
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	54.42982482910156
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."	47.4901123046875
she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	56.194053649902344
"i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	49.439109802246094
the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	82.35246276855469
well, monday morning came, and i was in
such a fuss!	56.11637878417969
it was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr darcy!	73.5322265625
"has she been presented?	52.33694839477539
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	47.6379508972168
the others have been gone on to scarborough,
these three weeks."	26.33279037475586
shocking!"	70.62581634521484
so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	120.20211029052734
are the others coming out?"	100.0215072631836
"a place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	83.72415161132812
we all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	73.21943664550781
mr darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.	48.49138641357422
darcy was fixed in astonishment.	55.878543853759766
"it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	111.24444580078125
she will be taken good care of.	61.05970764160156
lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	60.02925109863281
to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what jane felt for bingley.	42.757076263427734
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	52.17821502685547
they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either."	68.34336853027344
"about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i
answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	61.29195785522461
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?	53.22770690917969
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it."	63.34123992919922
"it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	50.41594314575195
mr bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has
received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	53.939117431640625
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	68.8093032836914
"and i have another favour to ask.	57.32400131225586
your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."	54.124080657958984
young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	58.07102966308594
how he lived i know not.	35.38496398925781
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	56.683773040771484
though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was."	103.23404693603516
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	50.4416618347168
in the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
elizabeth, said,

"miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."	36.022212982177734
tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."	60.48985290527344
it will pass away soon enough."	52.035118103027344
widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she
deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	43.91836166381836
what could she mean by
it?	46.688838958740234
what shall we do with him?	49.14422607421875
she then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,

"come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	36.35297775268555
we had better go into the
avenue."	46.46226119995117
the
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	116.14705657958984
you see on
what a footing we are.	45.52250289916992
ever since i have known it, i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it.	30.712677001953125
i am impatient to see him."	54.27172088623047
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before.	35.09685134887695
i cannot think of it without abhorrence."	54.339088439941406
she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be.	73.80496215820312
"oh!	76.7095718383789
the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."	27.96001434326172
i will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn."	19.629308700561523
cried mrs gardiner.	55.69175338745117
i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	57.822959899902344
the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.	89.52387237548828
i often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.	52.33500671386719
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	64.27865600585938
if the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.	69.74923706054688
"miss elizabeth bennet!"	44.13429260253906
mr bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at netherfield house.	50.18968963623047
georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	56.509891510009766
mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	58.55058288574219
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	38.76325607299805
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	63.60692596435547
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	59.891700744628906
there was
another reason too for her opposition.	61.28617858886719
girls, can i do any
thing for you in meryton?	62.96809768676758
every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch.	38.09355926513672
"as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent
four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable."	61.116886138916016
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while mr darcy was attending them to their
carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	49.5649528503418
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	29.766006469726562
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	35.84074401855469
"yes, madam," said mrs bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.	49.23973083496094
"we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	64.24114990234375
"while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--i
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	48.314571380615234
they will
ruin your happiness.	72.56166076660156
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	22.30001449584961
lady catherine seemed pleased.	42.782474517822266
my dear lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us.	46.1712532043457
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner
thought of him, and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	52.96331024169922
i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	24.574403762817383
every thing
that is charming!	51.40757369995117
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	57.17159652709961
"it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	53.19912338256836
"i have already told her so once, by your desire."	22.837764739990234

my brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	83.3455810546875
your daughter
elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."	33.68964385986328
lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."	60.17360305786133
his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	67.99776458740234
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	37.713863372802734
"very well.	73.80496215820312
"oh!	48.78012466430664

acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming

be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.	49.43882751464844
elizabeth looked surprised.	35.589447021484375
said he, smiling.	60.8583869934082
"do not you want to know who has taken it?"	82.76708221435547
a single man of large fortune; four

i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."	41.273406982421875
"you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir."	77.00858306884766
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	77.65758514404297
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	52.896995544433594
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--mr bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.	64.1090087890625
"and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!	45.58637619018555

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

the very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	33.66508102416992
"you mistake me, my dear.	52.63730239868164
"not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."	31.773183822631836
"ah!"	53.39884567260742
the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	59.03841781616211
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."	76.46426391601562
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	27.365360260009766
it was all conjecture."	40.264583587646484
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his
wife?"	33.18841552734375
"mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	58.45573043823242
"for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."	34.332027435302734
for a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	52.76239013671875
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.	40.540000915527344
mr bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	46.73970413208008
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
netherfield.	47.8209342956543
mr denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, mr wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	49.297523498535156
though i
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
you."	59.412837982177734
i cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	50.872074127197266
on their being joined by mr bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	55.22609329223633
"come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	67.98505401611328
my reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	64.28984069824219
miss bingley was
engrossed by mr darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	59.76919174194336
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."	77.03638458251953
"there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel
fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in london.	45.65357208251953
"that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	59.69636154174805
"my dear mr bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	57.36446762084961
her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	39.55247497558594

"it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire.	117.00181579589844
the business was therefore soon settled.	42.51953125
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	44.49126434326172
his
attachment to rosings, certainly increases."	65.9736328125
their reception at home was most kind.	43.02040100097656
"lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent.	55.13215637207031
it was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.	109.75454711914062
bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	49.369285583496094
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	59.32205581665039
but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be
     indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--these causes
     must be stated, though briefly.--the situation of your mother's
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you.	81.27442932128906
it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	38.466278076171875
you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	52.50914764404297
her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	48.82639694213867
"mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library."	60.60265350341797
"mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.	40.52452850341797
said her mother.	62.56167221069336
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	43.18972396850586
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.	52.636436462402344
then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	49.07123947143555
and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen pemberley."	63.00383377075195
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	61.36595153808594
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	57.564937591552734
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	60.78990173339844
but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could."	37.704551696777344
pray read on."	72.67090606689453
her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	60.54176712036133
they attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas.	62.392513275146484
his debts are to be paid,
     amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased.	51.44194030761719
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	70.49227905273438
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be
dissuaded from it.	28.698944091796875
i mend
pens remarkably well."	52.98886489868164
she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."	81.99272155761719
now what have you to say?"	52.103145599365234
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect.	73.44125366210938
when the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	49.975772857666016
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?"	47.55535888671875
i am so happy.	47.39620590209961
after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "i _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	56.83883285522461
"do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	51.7823371887207
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	53.75156784057617
my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady
catherine.	30.328948974609375
_he_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."	31.53805160522461
elizabeth silently attended
her.	50.05559539794922
"true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	40.23369598388672
what will you think of my vanity?	55.02891159057617
she wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	86.13468170166016
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	37.23383331298828

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.	125.98202514648438
and what sort of table do they keep?	62.26842498779297
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	53.056358337402344
no one made any reply.	58.247554779052734
"i have no right to give _my_ opinion," said wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	60.11334991455078
i will take care of
myself, and of mr wickham too.	59.575477600097656
she has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall i call it?	28.70403480529785
said mr gardiner.	61.445655822753906
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	37.268699645996094
it is what every body says.	44.97637176513672
"yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	56.93844223022461
their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	53.347293853759766
he replied, and was again silent.	35.37565231323242
her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."	38.39296340942383
a small sum could not do all this."	36.83877944946289
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	60.700843811035156
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	56.28131103515625
mr collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	60.050777435302734
on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	49.366729736328125
"don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake!	64.13906860351562
but my dear lydia, i don't
at all like your going such a way off.	57.10560607910156
as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, mr darcy, and mr
darcy only, entered the room.	62.3121452331543
there was also a postscript to this
effect.	37.17521667480469
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady
catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."	42.97370529174805
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	69.24968719482422
"a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	50.26200485229492
"but not before they went to brighton?"	64.00482940673828
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	54.50048828125
"perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	60.99112319946289
she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	35.220218658447266
that he has neither integrity nor honour.	45.23283004760742
"but the wife of mr
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."	61.983890533447266
"perhaps i do.	36.385353088378906
in the hall they parted.	61.551658630371094
is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	50.395713806152344
his brother-in-law, mr hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	71.85509490966797
jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	84.85344696044922
"there has
been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way.	92.82964324951172
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	55.35548400878906
catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.	71.73240661621094
are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	45.668060302734375
was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	51.52947235107422
my
watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.	59.92074966430664
we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.	62.38373565673828
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	54.049278259277344
however, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a project gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"plain vanilla ascii" or other format used in the official version

you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "plain vanilla ascii" or other
form.	50.77360153198242
as it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	90.83243560791016
"are you not diverted?"	41.457725524902344
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?"	51.111244201660156
said mrs bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	32.57782745361328
i am most seriously displeased."	54.185665130615234
"next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky."	66.54794311523438
the power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	55.59544372558594
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"you are mistaken, mr darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."	35.23698043823242
"yes, she will remain there till christmas."	65.62101745605469
some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening.	64.45365905761719
at last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	68.69783782958984
"she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property."	60.478206634521484
it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	65.96463775634766
"certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am
not one of _them_.	65.41934967041016
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	57.00630569458008
howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined
     by mrs collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter,
     to whom i have related the affair.	58.194244384765625
i depend on you for that."	41.223175048828125
after a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	50.63203048706055
i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother
lady catherine.	76.29792785644531
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.	64.99208068847656
she has two nieces
of her own.	48.95532989501953
lydia came to
     us; and wickham had constant admission to the house.	71.74909210205078
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday.	37.14507293701172
well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	63.16028594970703
i always said it must be so, at last.	56.186336517333984
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	67.06902313232422
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"	66.5541000366211
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.	80.34732055664062
"an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth.	55.80201721191406
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	49.14372253417969
why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"	74.228515625
i wish i could see her.	66.55490112304688
it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	51.82074737548828
respect,
esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown.	80.55751037597656
"_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza," said
charlotte.	41.41094207763672
i am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.	53.84222412109375
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	35.50975799560547
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.	55.35649108886719
the motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him.	35.65781784057617
we have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."	51.05192184448242
"you forget that i have made no
answer.	65.1998291015625
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	66.94831085205078
"but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	44.99573516845703
"no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise."	59.284385681152344
who
are your uncles and aunts?	41.113399505615234
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.	52.4732551574707
"i do not know.	158.05279541015625
and poor mr darcy!	66.94326782226562
such
doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly.	61.083003997802734
the loo table, however, did not appear.	84.07019805908203
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	56.09053421020508
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	79.66292572021484
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!	62.40938186645508
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	56.299434661865234
when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	51.53471755981445
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	70.89122009277344
he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	92.72262573242188
"i desire you will do no such thing.	57.17865753173828
they may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."	55.89213562011719
"i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	140.8703155517578
"what, has she frightened away
some of your lovers?	68.54061889648438
and when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "i shall insist on their giving one also.	78.82869720458984
she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters.	59.17243576049805
miss
bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?	66.46407318115234
would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	63.233360290527344
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	53.48991394042969
her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	54.510379791259766
in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	30.54817771911621
it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in."	46.77771759033203
"did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	47.5600471496582
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."	55.591407775878906
every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	20.051607131958008
james's?"	27.001821517944336
i hope we
may often meet again."	49.14485549926758
after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, mr collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.	53.5809326171875
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	51.37996292114258
_your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.	48.7790641784668
our distress, my
     dear lizzy, is very great.	42.84125900268555
i thought i should have died.	58.070621490478516
many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i
despair.	30.33588218688965
"his father was an excellent man," said mrs gardiner.	47.93766403198242
"but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."	58.81829071044922
mr darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	61.0671272277832
the apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	43.233436584472656
it is admirable!"	63.510250091552734
lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	38.120704650878906
her colour
changed, and she said no more.	37.192169189453125
it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	46.179298400878906

1.e.2.	45.68256378173828
the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on mr darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	79.4668960571289
are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?	59.2137565612793
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	148.15345764160156
i am very, very sorry.	76.93400573730469

"when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."	90.44718170166016
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render mr darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	62.232566833496094
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time.	62.30765914916992
"he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"	73.8746337890625
she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	57.63755798339844
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	79.51071166992188
"i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about mr wickham.	74.9942855834961
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	58.94657516479492
the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street.	75.94493865966797
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	46.73986053466797
for my part, i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.	77.30958557128906
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.	52.501686096191406
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	64.09064483642578
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."	56.787357330322266
here comes hill.	60.105491638183594
in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and mr collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.	41.690059661865234
it mortifies me.	54.22024917602539
mr collins and charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	55.91631317138672
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him.	34.22798538208008
with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr wickham and the
officers, mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in mrs philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	42.689186096191406
the reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	50.87286376953125
scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	53.46986770629883
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	58.59093475341797
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would
     write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	42.29033660888672
"shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine, what is to
befall her?"	32.411869049072266
i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."	27.21329689025879
yes, i call it a _very_ easy distance."	56.77750778198242
you have no compassion on my poor nerves."	68.01290130615234
she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged mr collins's conversation to herself.	70.20620727539062
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.	45.035614013671875
the
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was elizabeth's intimate friend.	77.43528747558594
you will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	62.65801239013672
"_that_ you certainly shall."	72.03053283691406
from his garden, mr collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	108.45316314697266
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."	74.38343048095703
but will they make you happy?"	62.62984085083008
you must and shall be married by a special licence.	65.487548828125
say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.	39.84516525268555
"when is your next ball to be, lizzy?"	47.98483657836914
i defy even sir william lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	50.492977142333984
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs
bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly."	119.87584686279297
the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	35.1788330078125
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help.	41.3439826965332
she
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	40.39103317260742
to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	41.36037063598633
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	40.140045166015625
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.	51.99005126953125
where, where is my uncle?"	57.13829803466797
but the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."	50.323699951171875
we know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	49.03507614135742
pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	60.87176513671875
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty.	67.37144470214844
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	68.9217758178711
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	85.57606506347656
unfortunately an only son, for many years an only _child_
i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable, allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	34.57431411743164
mr bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	73.62836456298828
you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them."	72.06712341308594
"not yet," replied jane.	67.73567199707031
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	49.121246337890625
all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	69.33361053466797
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
that you should come together.	68.51728820800781
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	52.40163040161133
she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	47.162227630615234
but
my dearest love, tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of,
that i may have it to-morrow."	44.26509475708008
mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	47.58182907104492
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	37.622825622558594
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the
     address specified in section 4, "information about donations to
     the project gutenberg literary archive foundation."	38.119903564453125
let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	59.88119125366211
she will
make him a very proper wife."	44.07734298706055
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	48.76498031616211
"mr darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling.	61.18327713012695
it cannot be concealed from any one.	37.21807861328125
when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	67.103515625
"if you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	57.133060455322266
i hate such false
friends.	60.388954162597656
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.	67.0042953491211
here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	70.92144012451172
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	59.76620101928711
"poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!	65.1784439086914
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	22.98414421081543
but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet.	65.4271469116211
there was no want of discourse.	45.77075958251953
its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	54.571380615234375
"is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?"	36.25774383544922
"could i expect it to be otherwise!"	87.91407012939453
mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	68.05086517333984
"indeed i have, sir," was her answer.	63.32391357421875
"and have you answered the letter?"	69.4740982055664
i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	62.60873031616211
he
arranges the business just as he pleases."	40.25013732910156
but he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not.	102.01789855957031
"but i was embarrassed."	54.61077880859375
"my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	57.693214416503906
"but depend upon it, mr collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be
brought to reason.	59.1533088684082
had she not seen him in
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	47.3171272277832
their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	44.14002990722656
i shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance i require."	70.78076171875
"these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth.	41.8758659362793
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."	49.9337043762207
"_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it."	56.44041061401367
i do not know the
particulars, but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	67.37600708007812
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can
assure you, he informed me himself."	79.88259887695312
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.	55.336517333984375
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	26.472566604614258
i shall be back by dinner."	61.96221923828125
_that_ is all settled."	55.45641326904297
instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them."	46.76656723022461
but as to your
other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.	90.6195068359375
mr philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.	79.6885757446289
she answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	41.799041748046875
he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.	68.7078628540039
"yes; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	57.51511001586914
brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton."	45.837890625
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	58.7325325012207
an union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	68.72650909423828
yes--it would be much better to
wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again.	42.70006561279297
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	61.107154846191406
where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	55.465850830078125
the possibility of mr collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"engaged to mr collins!	53.99834060668945
her ladyship was highly incensed.	48.762821197509766
as
for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	59.17305374145508
what
     he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again
     to-morrow evening.	92.3843002319336
it is mr wickham's intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	44.179595947265625
"my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	67.98820495605469
"you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	63.888614654541016
"when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--oh!	47.874359130859375
they agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family.	52.092288970947266
"i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter!"	61.807010650634766
"my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"	93.90990447998047
mr bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	42.724365234375
copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.	45.99882125854492
how unlucky!	48.48271942138672
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings.	48.345542907714844
she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	79.44430541992188
i am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr darcy's
regard."	52.22383117675781
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	50.9681510925293
bromley, of course.--if you mention my name at the bell,
you will be attended to."	73.3699951171875
i did not know before, that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	107.9886245727539
is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	41.0624885559082
"my motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	47.021053314208984
"take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	62.3995361328125
mr wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr collins for
a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.	40.31227493286133
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."	119.83556365966797
after tea, mr bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument.	37.059288024902344
what say you,
mary?	68.87213134765625
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."	37.73757553100586
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire.	59.93194580078125
"it is more than i engage for, i assure you."	55.79579162597656
they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	53.401065826416016
said her aunt.	52.26637268066406
they are not married,
     nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
     your side, i hope it will not be long before they are.	57.78960418701172
consider mr collins's respectability, and
charlotte's prudent, steady character.	70.04817199707031
"your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	55.23933792114258
having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	51.16131591796875
they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs
bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what elizabeth felt.	70.35597229003906
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."	64.29804992675781
in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	54.57261657714844
it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	66.94029998779297
mrs bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	50.10072708129883
"you may as well call it impertinence at once.	91.57557678222656
had i known what
i ought, what i dared, to do!	89.76971435546875
he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	51.82469940185547
"you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	54.216739654541016
she had been unwilling to
mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.	89.71040344238281
his fear of her, has always operated, i
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he
has very much at heart."	54.53423309326172
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	61.56040954589844
mrs bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	46.377872467041016
young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."	40.38935470581055
long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	64.34467315673828
"you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	51.730857849121094
"and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	76.86968231201172
but, lizzy!	34.148765563964844
he had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other
     person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions.	84.5514907836914
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	47.975311279296875
many small donations
$1 to $5,000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.	47.532352447509766
her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for mr gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	63.52553939819336
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	84.576416015625
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	52.26504898071289
she
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	38.62083435058594
mr gardiner declared his
willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	28.189563751220703
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.	43.481510162353516
cried elizabeth.	53.27079391479492
"no governess!	54.268497467041016
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when mr denny comes back from town."	58.21531295776367
on the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	77.79650115966797
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.	42.23323440551758
"dear lizzy!"	84.78865051269531
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	48.32264709472656
but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--mr bingley will not be detained in london by
them."	42.91856384277344
and as i come back, i can call on
lady lucas and mrs long.	25.06249237060547
if an individual project gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder, the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees
or charges.	52.66505813598633
it is nearly fifty miles."	48.09600067138672
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	26.80615997314453
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty.	16.68379020690918
mr bennet treated the matter differently.	41.49910354614258
lord!	78.9427490234375
i never saw such a long chin in my life.	53.20050811767578
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	58.1370849609375
what a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"	95.05931091308594
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."	51.55807876586914
is she handsome?"	62.2178840637207
the foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united
states.	76.64620208740234
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	52.115596771240234
it gives me pain
to speak ill of a darcy.	52.259368896484375
charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where mrs bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.	73.80496215820312
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy."	105.58470153808594
"oh!	59.94658660888672
and now here's mr bennet gone away, and i know he will fight
wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	128.65719604492188
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	64.37598419189453
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too!	37.55885314941406
and when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; mr bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	70.03932189941406
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	65.3182373046875
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	53.9796257019043
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	83.8446044921875
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	61.14990997314453
"my dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	70.6548843383789
he scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	66.8818130493164
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy,
received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question.	58.246856689453125
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	56.61820983886719
unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	111.30472564697266
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	67.72943115234375
i promised
them so faithfully!	60.30182647705078
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"	80.07487487792969
"nothing child, nothing.	71.78831481933594
the first week of their return was soon gone.	48.10525131225586
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	72.19775390625
in short,
i will do my best."	88.4202880859375
but our visitor
     was very obstinate.	75.99710083007812
to
put me on my guard?	42.54043960571289
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	59.27983474731445
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	59.85361099243164
"what is mr darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?	76.77298736572266
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr denny had
brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	56.13899230957031
at such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	58.957427978515625
she
had ventured only one glance at darcy.	30.345975875854492
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which i have never acknowledged.	56.154090881347656
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	49.930686950683594
i will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."	72.26870727539062
"that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	58.03457260131836
"come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance.	40.75982666015625
she was gone directly.	57.11622619628906
i am
going away myself."	82.9643325805664
"certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	51.1367301940918
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	56.966552734375
even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and
monday, endurable to kitty and lydia.	61.42924499511719
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do.	50.0915412902832
how are you all?"	80.41830444335938
"miss bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	41.75865173339844
the officers will find
women better worth their notice.	60.172569274902344
lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	67.8979721069336
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	57.92702865600586
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated
elopement.	52.49671173095703
bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	57.991397857666016
they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,

"come, mr wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	81.45809936523438
"no, not at all."	68.53921508789062
i should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.	48.1302490234375
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	48.9039192199707
"i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	100.17607116699219
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	43.820220947265625
had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	112.47630310058594
i want to talk very seriously.	66.33305358886719
and his sisters are charming women.	73.47513580322266
"the conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved
in civility."	65.42620849609375
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	64.94446563720703
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	55.923194885253906
what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	53.443580627441406
the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine.	69.2119140625
"i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister philips.	51.810184478759766
lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."	57.78947067260742
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton, these visitors came.	60.28348159790039
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly
calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	45.42208480834961
i do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
     be deceived again.	108.79199981689453
"did you go by the village of kympton?"	78.63123321533203
this is the estimation in which you hold me!	66.45430755615234
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	65.0137710571289
and rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr collins thus
addressed her,

"when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."	52.214508056640625
our poor mother
     is sadly grieved.	59.00155258178711
"oh, lizzy!	55.746009826660156
her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	83.19607543945312
with many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for mrs bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"good lord!	71.58250427246094
but at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.	43.42356491088867
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.	57.30970764160156
you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."	78.74510955810547
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	73.82808685302734
but the fact is, that
being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, who, however, may live many years longer, i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
for several years.	40.27854537963867
but in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.	74.61675262451172
mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	54.596744537353516
"i do not pretend to
regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	58.70811462402344
information about the mission of project gutenberg-tm

project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.	75.21593475341797
while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	52.209476470947266
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.	54.149723052978516
a
most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house!	81.32044219970703
my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
as i might have done!	54.572669982910156
"from the former.	41.55376052856445
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!	53.00901794433594
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	70.13172149658203
my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	49.7572135925293
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	61.818885803222656
"my dear, you flatter me.	73.0350341796875
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	103.48841094970703
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	51.14434051513672
but, alas!	25.095216751098633
mr darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr bingley
never stirs without him."	47.13132858276367
[illustration: morning dress.	48.80360412597656
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	82.04662322998047
mrs bennet and kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone mr collins began.	66.80445861816406
mr darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	76.12367248535156
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your
     attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
     demand it of your justice.	55.83869552612305
the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than mr bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.	60.60406494140625
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia.	63.355892181396484
she was
sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	50.58979797363281
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am
_not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things."	40.92666244506836
they were ignorant, idle, and vain.	84.38856506347656
mr bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. mrs bennet was quite
disconcerted.	48.24024963378906
"do you really think so?"	57.973392486572266
"and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty.	42.28712844848633
but,
my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	73.66067504882812
for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	44.019046783447266
what a fine thing for our girls!"	39.197792053222656
she wrote even
to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	45.069053649902344
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"miss elizabeth bennet."	48.12400436401367
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the project gutenberg-tm
collection.	84.16734313964844
without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.	29.49884033203125
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	71.73411560058594
you tear them to pieces."	35.04616165161133
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	58.26982498168945
she comes to us to-day.	56.658042907714844
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	84.19242858886719
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs long," said miss lucas, "but i
wish he had danced with eliza."	55.336753845214844
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	63.836631774902344
i shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on.	52.90659713745117
to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	56.972469329833984
perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	58.023590087890625
i cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done."	49.45542526245117
the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
dovedale, or the peak.	92.83210754394531
as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	59.2833137512207
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	67.33319091796875
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.	74.17021179199219
in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	51.94108963012695
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."	53.07677459716797
"i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen.	74.70935821533203
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	80.17880249023438
the hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.	32.17742156982422
but do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	66.67897033691406
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	53.54280090332031
she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.	64.98290252685547
i was very
uncomfortable, i may say unhappy.	31.207979202270508
four nieces
of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	43.66722869873047
so tall!--oh, my
dear lizzy!	46.092674255371094
yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
first, you may remember."	69.30677032470703
my father bears it better.	77.97992706298828
"upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	71.3674087524414
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion.	72.38200378417969
sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	49.75006103515625
not a syllable was uttered by either; and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	61.65174102783203
1.f.6.	51.94095230102539
the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh!	79.01498413085938
his marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy."	62.876766204833984
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth.	95.6884994506836
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	68.57837677001953
mrs collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	46.86433029174805
i wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if i had not asked you!	41.95128631591797
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley.	65.79589080810547
"i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked.	66.67328643798828
the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings.	59.89286422729492
"the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."	44.304298400878906
if you'll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight.	61.51930236816406
till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	55.40267562866211
"why, my dear, you must know, mrs long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."	110.44127655029297
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	57.966041564941406
only think!	51.77998352050781
"your's sincerely, &c."

miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	64.8118667602539
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."	39.25724411010742
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	55.43452072143555
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.	55.084041595458984
i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr
darcy."	89.96421813964844
"i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr collins was wishing to
marry you.	71.94876098632812
"but does lydia know nothing of this?	67.92815399169922
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	57.11655807495117
as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	89.7132797241211
my visit was
not long, as caroline and mrs hurst were going out.	63.389251708984375
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	69.10108184814453
such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.	60.17595672607422
but she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.	97.39208221435547
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.	66.03031921386719
no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	77.02760314941406
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	51.451419830322266
'tis as good as a lord!	98.271240234375
on
mr and mrs gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	78.0251235961914
the least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	48.39959716796875
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	92.43330383300781
this invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	23.193574905395508
we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun!	72.10438537597656
"yes, she did."	68.18416595458984
and turning round, he looked for a moment at
elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	52.2047233581543
mrs bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	60.64950942993164
"no more have i," said mr bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."	103.6009292602539
a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but mr darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	10.309560775756836
"the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	93.06275939941406
oh!	66.79296112060547
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	73.15758514404297
she says lizzy had better have taken mr
collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	97.02094268798828
the first part of mrs gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	43.61602783203125
the reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as i have given above.	66.82239532470703
mr darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.	73.3230209350586
his appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	78.10742950439453
but is it
certain, absolutely certain?"	43.281517028808594
she was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr darcy,
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.	57.315311431884766
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it."	71.66941833496094
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	59.404483795166016
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
from netherfield, and was opened immediately.	74.51957702636719
you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, i am sure you did.	34.68932342529297
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

"what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam?	51.09590530395508
said
jane.--"i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her."	54.01441192626953
"it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	68.64983367919922
have you heard from my uncle?"	48.22797775268555
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."	70.63248443603516
her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,

"i can guess the subject of your reverie."	53.720149993896484
and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	46.135223388671875
it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	96.65287780761719
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs
bennet instantly answered,

"oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am
sure she can have no objection.--come, kitty, i want you up stairs."	53.86762237548828
what relates to yourself, is as follows.	75.12158966064453
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	75.69319915771484
"'tis an etiquette i despise," said he.	63.72587203979492
she was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.	47.605491638183594
"aye, there she comes," continued mrs bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided
she can have her own way.--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_i_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i
told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	44.73460006713867
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look
on as a point of duty.	84.86599731445312
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
mrs bennet give up the point.	43.23583984375
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	57.89617919921875
"thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you
all, and then wickham would be angry."	60.251731872558594
"if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it."	56.598289489746094
of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself.	54.84143829345703
well, how pleased i am!	53.829078674316406
"i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.	72.62628936767578
every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.	87.21211242675781
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	108.94706726074219
their powers of conversation were considerable.	53.30662155151367
i know not what to think.	59.50537872314453
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	39.27582931518555
i have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older."	62.62264633178711
"removed!"	68.84051513671875
but there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	82.79573822021484
their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach.	51.69460678100586
mrs long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.	59.08091735839844
hear me in silence.	47.537384033203125

had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."	67.22518157958984
has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	46.4305419921875
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	85.27503967285156
i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."	44.2318000793457
"he is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	74.89855194091797
i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner.	44.79552459716797
"they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	67.87677001953125
but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	69.72512817382812
"indeed i am.	61.34093475341797
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	46.9835205078125
he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	50.882965087890625
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."	38.64225769042969
mrs hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	87.26141357421875
"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
all."	51.78485870361328
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	70.5660629272461
who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	51.496768951416016
"has your governess left you?"	43.95012664794922
the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days.	53.08090591430664
i understand that mr collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	58.64865493774414
i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	80.52398681640625
had it been your uncle's doing, i must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	55.11664962768555
the business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	73.22190856933594
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon.	88.60523223876953
i was ready to die of laughter.	49.03874588012695
a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	59.6063117980957
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	71.46947479248047
"perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	57.34374237060547
perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now.	138.610107421875
when
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	65.52418518066406
"and so was i."	86.0737533569336
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
"i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him
ever since he was four years old."	59.81358337402344
are
you going much farther?"	51.09122848510742
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma?	47.55657958984375
"oh, jane,
take care."	62.40143966674805
he was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	54.773460388183594
mrs bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by
the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
meryton.	64.58314514160156
i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	74.087890625
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	49.08584213256836
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished.	62.197410583496094
has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	97.58987426757812
people do not die of little
trifling colds.	90.02581024169922
"exceed their income!	50.105384826660156
i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	64.79447174072266
"what could become of mr bingley and jane!"	38.509517669677734
it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."	51.92702865600586
"then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."	37.157405853271484
"about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i
understand."	50.519020080566406
"i must not decide on my own performance."	77.890625
i knew how it
would be.	53.04487228393555
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	504.3028259277344
"mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."	55.12201690673828
"la!	75.56304931640625
"you are too hasty, sir," she cried.	53.343074798583984
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of
superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas."	82.0276870727539
at our time of life, it is not so
pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	73.80496215820312
the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	39.6111946105957
"oh!	45.63602828979492
mrs
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party.	56.512882232666016
only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	55.276546478271484
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	29.08534812927246
they were not the only objects of mr collins's admiration.	66.6125259399414
"yes, in conjunction with his friend."	45.514488220214844
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
her resigned.	93.87301635742188
dear lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	49.42598342895508
"la!"	38.31588363647461
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her."	49.93309783935547
can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	47.354331970214844
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them.	68.99365234375
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"	43.905941009521484
they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	58.909095764160156
i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	74.41759490966797
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr
darcy and herself.	56.10430908203125
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	73.22330474853516
mrs gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	115.43485260009766
that such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."	46.31985855102539
when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	43.50421905517578
"i suspected as much," replied elizabeth.	56.12553024291992
cried he, turning towards her.	45.35367202758789
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	59.920345306396484
"it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."	92.19445037841797
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	74.41692352294922
though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.	76.06949615478516
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	64.36673736572266
at length, she spoke again.	64.25477600097656
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.	76.18904113769531
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr
collins too!--why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"	55.156272888183594
they could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	43.7762451171875
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?"	66.98046875
said she.	56.28120803833008
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "oh!	78.17922973632812
your
reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.'	43.394142150878906
lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
good humoured as lydia.	77.52265930175781

pride and prejudice:

a novel.	62.098140716552734
but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	54.18452835083008
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	80.95626068115234
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	69.7691879272461
"and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	41.40360641479492
colonel forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon.	52.680233001708984
my father is going to
     london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her.	95.83959197998047
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	55.66934585571289
our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----you shall try it
some day.--do your sisters play and sing?"	91.78849029541016
"yes, she called yesterday with her father.	79.20861053466797
he delighted in
going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	50.70989227294922
but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	35.23008346557617
miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	62.014366149902344
"indeed i do not dare."	76.08397674560547
so imprudent a
     match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood.	48.101261138916016
could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?	77.56857299804688
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg-tm
license as specified in paragraph 1.e.1.	55.8876838684082
her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	55.91492462158203
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."	73.56751251220703
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.	72.60125732421875
all that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum.	35.247440338134766
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	16.75234031677246
these recollections will not do at
all.	67.07148742675781
"let us sit down.	54.68428421020508
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on wednesday or thursday.	43.228271484375
"it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."

"that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	73.47600555419922
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"you mean to frighten me, mr darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	87.80174255371094
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	54.985713958740234
"she is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	47.73478698730469
i cannot quite agree with you _there_.	52.891700744628906
she was teazed by
mr collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.	82.21324920654297
"if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to
understand it.	53.23967742919922
more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	66.62609100341797
"but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
every thing will be well."	60.295326232910156
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	75.76480865478516
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	71.24595642089844
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!	103.88977813720703
miss bingley i am sure cannot.	64.87396240234375
"what is there of good to be expected?"	169.48110961914062
"i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	64.89344787597656
"and this is your real opinion!	57.65360641479492
believe her to be deceived by all means.	56.67950439453125
one day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	68.10782623291016
a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and mrs bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.	31.53057098388672
she received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.	22.650074005126953
"insolent girl!"	61.69723892211914
things are settled so
oddly."	92.97905731201172
"what did you say of me, that i did not deserve?	78.2114486694336
the officer was the very
mr denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	82.28192138671875
before any answer could arrive from mr collins, or any congratulations
to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.	66.14988708496094
it was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	73.80496215820312
on entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	41.88008499145508
"oh!	46.05733871459961
"while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mr
bingley."	29.294857025146484
"another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with _him_,
if i were you."	60.43896484375
adieu.	73.16544342041016
"why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley.	56.524742126464844
"wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as jane's."	67.05239868164062
wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.	41.792762756347656
"but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."	52.157894134521484
"i never saw any one so shocked.	55.07771682739258
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	35.83568572998047
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	68.96632385253906
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	29.774991989135742
he had never had the
slightest suspicion.	66.01205444335938
"my dear father, i congratulate you."	55.42164993286133
she was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself.	43.43307113647461
"i am going
to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows."	95.51495361328125
"it is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	55.581424713134766
one
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	55.329097747802734
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	53.914573669433594
but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from the want of money.	54.23571014404297
your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."	63.56266403198242
come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.	74.59004211425781
i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield.	29.3681697845459
this was
very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of mr collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	58.18636703491211
i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."	65.14898681640625
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object.	40.44719696044922
now, lizzy, i think i _have_
surprised you.	47.06298828125
but, however, he is very welcome to
come to netherfield, if he likes it.	52.38037872314453
"do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa, you will not mind my
waking mr hurst."	55.70846176147461
my father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	62.99587631225586
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.	60.290409088134766
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	25.22164535522461
mr gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	74.69878387451172
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said
elizabeth.	65.48892211914062
"from mr collins!	72.95909118652344
elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	68.12923431396484
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	57.29959487915039
another day i will do the same; i will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as i can,--or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away."	78.84365844726562
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	69.8306655883789
"i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"	74.51502990722656
here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	65.12885284423828
she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	82.0511245727539
let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr
darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has
treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner.	106.76207733154297
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	57.209556579589844
my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	71.40070343017578
he had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us.	235.5045928955078
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once.	88.27486419677734
what congratulations will
then flow in!	75.33732604980469
he has
children of his own, and may have more.	69.83525848388672
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	10.309560775756836
she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	56.65642547607422
oh!	93.9101333618164
but you have chosen your fault well.--i
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	64.3896713256836
he has not an ill-natured
look.	73.73640441894531
"i honour your circumspection.	58.902828216552734
i owe all that i know
of it, to another, not to you."	47.12529373168945
and she rose as she spoke.	60.1555290222168
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again.	59.644744873046875
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane, who were dancing together.	71.7353744506836
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	93.4085922241211
what does he say?	55.346195220947266
it needed all
jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.	54.9329833984375
elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	59.6325798034668
from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry mr collins, and i will never see you again
if you _do_."	126.56082153320312
i am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	78.0727310180664
"as often as i can.	46.7895393371582
but
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	44.97846603393555
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley.	72.22516632080078
mrs long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	35.15812301635742
lord, how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty!	67.2723159790039
mrs bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."	36.417022705078125
the
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	83.20159912109375
"you have insulted me, in every possible method.	41.189937591552734
"very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	56.000335693359375
it was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	63.596492767333984
you must not suspect me.	54.838348388671875
"it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	81.05232238769531
his character
     was to speak for itself.	62.40319061279297
indeed, mr darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	86.13107299804688
"no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."	43.501834869384766
i have written to colonel forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which i have pledged myself.	93.75899505615234
but you do not know _all_.	51.52888107299805
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	46.94181823730469
"yes, sir, i know i am.	72.30772399902344
she related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	43.24897384643555
on both sides it was only assertion.	39.51396560668945
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.	57.755226135253906
how he must have felt it!"	60.72257995605469
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant.	54.390464782714844
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear
     wickham, you must be very happy.	34.781517028808594
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	60.16069412231445
"his misfortunes!"	56.82021713256836
well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	52.33480453491211
cried mrs bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	71.70394134521484
the note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	60.28046798706055
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	35.7297248840332

at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	52.61777114868164
what am i to do?"	96.31977844238281
"he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."	77.01603698730469
"your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."	63.30183792114258
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	86.35819244384766
she was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr
darcy, she was directly retreating.	73.19649505615234
her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	47.544124603271484
my temper i dare not vouch
for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	49.917259216308594
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	49.935516357421875
"may i ask to what these questions tend?"	167.5313720703125
my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	45.75426483154297
"this is a wretched beginning indeed!	84.68306732177734
excuse me--for i must speak plainly.	75.67381286621094
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	66.07866668701172
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	43.68750762939453
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	61.73478317260742
there was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	73.80496215820312
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added kitty.	75.9684066772461
"oh!	59.339027404785156
in short, my dear aunt, i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	49.75006103515625
you are not going to be _missish_, i
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	41.79650115966797
1.e.6.	131.32298278808594
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!	86.20539093017578
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	73.67047119140625
elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	51.46319580078125
her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity.	204.61463928222656
"so, lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love i find.	86.80941772460938
"you did!	34.02899169921875
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.	90.8281021118164
i must speak to hill, this moment."	63.564353942871094
does she live near you, sir?"	163.2108917236328
"my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women's do.	62.71799850463867
"money!	52.356781005859375
day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	69.24149322509766
"oh, no!"	57.072452545166016
"not at all.	48.803897857666016
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr bingley.	79.38043212890625
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	64.90034484863281
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long.	89.97610473632812
the feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	63.75477600097656
those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	63.876644134521484
then, the two third he danced with miss
king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----"

"if he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much!	51.77766036987305
he owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	54.61783218383789
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	46.06851577758789
"you have said quite enough, madam.	68.12394714355469
i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	45.74325180053711
we are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	68.02902221679688
the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.	56.14873504638672
i really do not think georgiana
darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	53.493408203125
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i
hope, though you have but a short lease."	73.80496215820312
she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter.	65.56194305419922
"oh!	106.52312469482422
she has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for
ever."	174.99497985839844
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.	73.80496215820312
what is to become of us!	58.136085510253906
"oh!	75.912353515625
i told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	53.87586975097656
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	48.19691848754883
she had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.	64.07646179199219
mr darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."	52.81474304199219
but it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham.	58.285945892333984
"my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.	88.23467254638672
"how should you have liked making sermons?"	72.64655303955078
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds
was of no trifling nature.	56.24761962890625
i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name.	39.215728759765625
"only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."	37.875205993652344
when tea was over, mr hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	64.76402282714844
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly."	40.791770935058594
here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	61.829322814941406
"my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street."	51.13414764404297
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs bennet.--they had several children.	60.499000549316406
such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	42.00524139404297
"well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	58.26516342163086
"in the first place," replied mr gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland."	41.45648956298828
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another mr collins in time."	42.82740783691406
there
is nothing he would not do for her."	50.848602294921875
as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs bennet followed her,
saying,

"i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	51.65243911743164
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"oh!	76.72452545166016
my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.	71.45860290527344
miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.	59.86326217651367
she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.	52.353824615478516
had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	74.53787994384766
they are gone down to
newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, i do not know how long.	47.85087585449219
she saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	43.06935119628906
miss darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	28.189563751220703
"and may i ask?"	83.1985092163086
cried elizabeth.	62.41938018798828
the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	141.87962341308594
and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and mrs bennet, i am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.	10.309560775756836
nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	61.89705276489258
oh!	55.599632263183594
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy's
looks and behaviour.	90.52444458007812
but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	63.70912551879883
so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.	64.85104370117188
the whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	78.97317504882812
he now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
well as of mr darcy.	97.95650482177734
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	52.9708137512207
but mr bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	62.08890151977539
that _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	43.0417594909668
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	58.43349075317383
if she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.	56.20649337768555
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.
unless a copyright notice is included.	47.70935821533203
cried he.	56.83384704589844
"yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	115.01930236816406
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"i am not."	84.06979370117188
"i hope not so.	67.59263610839844
but it must not, shall not be.	71.43498992919922
they insist also on
     my seeing mr jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.	285.3147888183594
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.	111.50094604492188
what felicity!	73.8800277709961
she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	68.88937377929688
i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had."	42.993927001953125
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr darcy by
character perfectly well.	65.16915893554688
though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	77.90816497802734
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	68.14567565917969
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	44.99001693725586
elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.	47.263916015625
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	54.645973205566406
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	68.05663299560547
she enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	62.3338737487793
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	59.70339584350586
*       *       *       *       *

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	56.56439971923828
our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."	68.73155212402344
the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	44.75230026245117
by supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.	44.36176300048828
"have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"	70.45484161376953
"but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that mrs long has promised to introduce him."	64.53915405273438
his pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by.	61.70844650268555
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	62.37775421142578
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.	42.18568420410156
who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after
your arrival!"	42.18973159790039
their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
at pemberley, before they left the country.	58.047752380371094
it was only said, 'lately,
george wickham, esq.	50.325748443603516
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	61.09661102294922
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.	24.012590408325195
well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next?	49.93583679199219
repeated miss bingley.	70.07600402832031
generous, good man, i am afraid he has
distressed himself.	58.075050354003906
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.	74.42398071289062
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	65.94010925292969
you have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.	68.55074310302734
who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	51.42848587036133
mr collins made his
declaration in form.	59.14506912231445
i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?"	65.64517974853516
and there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	144.91172790527344
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated.	57.585418701171875
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	56.8492431640625
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"	54.96974563598633
any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far."	50.13800811767578
she is quite a little
creature.	56.134334564208984
wretched, wretched, mistake!"	20.715290069580078
"she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."	81.92081451416016
mr bennet made no answer.	130.9545440673828
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	48.564964294433594
"and they _must_ marry!	62.8858528137207
"you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	80.94622039794922
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	65.00977325439453
her many attractions were again dwelt on, and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.	55.107295989990234
she had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	38.74883270263672
on the contrary every particular relative
to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and
if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who
will believe me?	55.670936584472656
"mrs collins, you must send a servant with them.	51.864479064941406
"but,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	49.65342712402344
she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs hurst and
miss bingley.	72.70893096923828
we were
married, you know, at st. clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	60.199432373046875
"and then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	41.965972900390625
the first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached
     mr bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr
     wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--but
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--if, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry.--the
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i
     had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with
     others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the
     dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that
     ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made
     acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that
     bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage.	41.309844970703125
they
followed her into the dining-parlour.	71.05694580078125
but mrs
bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	99.95299530029297
the girls stared at their father.	23.745174407958984
"gracechurch-street, sept. 6.	60.610511779785156
the tête-à-tête surprised
them.	72.88992309570312
she really
looked almost wild."	47.92851638793945
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	83.64450073242188
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly."	55.821529388427734
_we_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."	73.54499053955078
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	73.26557159423828
you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."	54.114990234375
but he is an ugly fellow!	50.98859405517578
it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	71.07839965820312
mrs bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth,

"miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	46.95921325683594
by you, i was properly humbled.	78.7152328491211
we passed each other
several times.	65.58747863769531
it would be dreadful!	45.42388153076172
it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	77.57328033447266
anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	74.83743286132812
"but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
next day."	27.333343505859375
[illustration: a vicarage house.]	43.766300201416016
a clergyman like you must marry.--chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.	53.14805603027344
"you write uncommonly fast."	58.83478927612305
lady
catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.	42.65058898925781
if you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.	60.01542663574219
"_you_ began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs bennet with civil
self-command to miss lucas.	68.72362518310547
"he is certainly a good brother," said elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	76.7745132446289
you must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."	46.33262252807617
the housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	74.29779052734375
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection."	64.39055633544922
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	62.69222640991211
mrs
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged jane to borrow mr bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	47.36294937133789
but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	53.56279373168945
but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."	65.07080841064453
"and you saw him frequently?"	54.01313400268555
"by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; i wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer
     for being coherent.	44.36777114868164
i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	60.017913818359375
i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	127.7305679321289
but we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."	52.647159576416016
what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.	58.30693435668945
your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	66.02710723876953
at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."	68.06741333007812
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	60.9781494140625
"i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper i ever met with.	55.94981002807617
in her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	134.72515869140625
as for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin elizabeth."	98.54983520507812
miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present.	57.677921295166016
how does georgiana get on, darcy?"	71.31403350830078
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	87.2411880493164
"is that his design in settling here?"	62.16960144042969
the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"are you pleased with kent?"	73.80496215820312
by mrs hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	83.00227355957031
"the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.	64.48999786376953
"oh!	77.02066802978516
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	38.429927825927734
kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton.	52.03158187866211
"we have heard only once.	50.024864196777344
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	68.0078125
"but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
opportunity."	70.4024887084961
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."	61.3973274230957
you have widely mistaken my
character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	55.63246154785156
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world i love, and he is an angel.	23.889310836791992
"i am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	63.79658889770508
this mrs
     younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	43.716819763183594
heaven forbid!	46.42186737060547
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.	75.72272491455078
"laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	180.2530517578125
did he know of
their intending to go off?	96.45568084716797
her answer was warmly in his favour.	50.430030822753906
in this danger kitty
is also comprehended.	59.19735336303711
"but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	23.66259002685547
and one of my
own daughters.	61.058658599853516
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	71.29418182373047
three daughters married!	49.2642936706543
he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in derbyshire.	49.20457458496094

she now lost every expectation of pleasure.	48.06746292114258
mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.	59.03487014770508
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	48.23088836669922
you have a sweet room here, mr bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	61.833213806152344
"you are severe on us."	47.50397491455078
"there can be no doubt of that.	52.879432678222656
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	64.92554473876953
"she is so fond of mrs forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!	53.00284194946289
"she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.	41.990882873535156
after a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	72.13616180419922
when she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	144.39035034179688
"i do not believe a word of it, my dear.	40.00095748901367
"so much the better.	65.43042755126953
i _must_ have employment and society.	52.470787048339844
you
may have drawn him in."	303.55718994140625
to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	59.59684371948242
but jane was to go home with her, and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	56.038909912109375
and his
answering immediately to the last question--oh!	88.3844985961914
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	69.90216064453125

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	59.24818801879883
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	61.002201080322266
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."	56.46256637573242
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	170.58888244628906
had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	89.58524322509766
lady
catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	90.21630096435547
i was never more annoyed!	70.28119659423828
"does that young lady know mr darcy?"	41.066688537597656
his sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.	70.40748596191406
to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	64.84024810791016
her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	107.5982437133789
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of mr darcy, she could not
but allow that mr bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	64.87568664550781
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to mr bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	64.49392700195312
and who knows what _may_ happen?	97.12374114990234
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	50.40528869628906
"certainly not; at first.	49.984222412109375
your's, very
     sincerely,

     "m.	69.312255859375
he has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	71.33174896240234
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	50.21287155151367
"_you_ observed it, mr darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."	82.61251831054688
cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	56.74248123168945
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	71.90997314453125
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library."	31.97077178955078
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."	64.13359069824219
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	504.3028259277344
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	37.548824310302734
forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."	116.5321044921875
darcy mentioned his letter.	84.45015716552734
"la!	49.352256774902344
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	81.06005096435547
"good gracious!	71.33165740966797
the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year.	56.471561431884766
he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire.	114.19444274902344
she could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	53.62297821044922
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	80.1966323852539
she will follow wherever lydia leads.	47.06000518798828
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	66.40412902832031
"no--why should he?	78.5496826171875
they were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	116.35160064697266
no.--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."	51.3325080871582
"indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	42.13724136352539
"i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	56.2615966796875
but slyness seems the fashion.	73.80496215820312
"i advise mr darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs bennet, "to walk
to oakham mount this morning.	72.91238403320312
"excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant."	58.75157928466797
but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."	38.6909065246582
"oh!	74.17544555664062
you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	62.37767028808594
towards _him_ i have been
kinder than towards myself."	54.04417037963867
"that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."	61.299537658691406
"and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently.	82.91790008544922
and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,

"indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	61.7364616394043
he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	63.31153106689453
*       *       *       *       *

"good gracious!"	72.16770935058594
she was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	61.56267166137695
amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	60.487571716308594
"my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.	64.2872314453125
their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially,
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	38.231712341308594
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.	56.366188049316406
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist
mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.	56.0374641418457
two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, mrs bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	53.34526062011719
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."	72.93380737304688
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	63.56380844116211
"i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	64.08682250976562
but we are all liable to
error.	45.93608093261719
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	51.168087005615234
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	54.0944709777832
no one but mrs bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.	38.751136779785156
other schemes too came into her head.	77.7032241821289
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	38.937889099121094
"we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine and
lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.	82.18777465820312
"a gamester!"	66.11602020263672
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which
i have not already heard.	49.793540954589844
you must not disappoint your father."	75.17945861816406
were questions with which she amused herself.	65.97102355957031
your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	47.30549621582031
i cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family."	51.49639892578125
wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."	50.8646354675293
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	63.23239517211914
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."	59.3254508972168
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time.	19.325334548950195
it is really too distressing.	56.567237854003906
but tell me, what did you come down to
netherfield for?	49.41471481323242
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	53.91084289550781
sir william had been
delighted with him.	44.98727798461914
"i have just had a letter from
jane, with such dreadful news.	56.01353454589844
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm
license terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	57.335811614990234
see paragraph 1.e below.	76.85748291015625
_i_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	41.0518913269043
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring?"	49.33198547363281
he
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	86.5243148803711
how i long to see her!	50.44975280761719
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time.	53.45330047607422
"i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."	64.82794189453125
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.	69.81005096435547
a young man, such
as you describe mr bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	78.09864044189453
but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	42.96982192993164
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	49.205169677734375
my poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room.	85.25084686279297
_my_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late mr darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property.	26.769277572631836
i am sure you must feel it
so."	66.4405517578125
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."	63.409934997558594
what a good joke it will be!	73.65642547607422
"mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself?"	44.187721252441406
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	95.60088348388672
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	64.67066955566406
stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."	74.659423828125
allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	176.56849670410156
having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	67.2679214477539
you dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."	58.73317337036133
"nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	56.82753372192383
have you seen any pleasant men?	67.67865753173828
it was an
encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
very strenuously have opposed it.	61.77684020996094
"do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	114.10006713867188
"if i," said mr collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	48.88349533081055
that his two sisters and mr darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	60.04441833496094
but, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."	70.38490295410156
"not the slightest.	86.43972778320312
and you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."	47.364280700683594
they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically anything with public domain ebooks.	44.195674896240234
i know your
disposition, lizzy.	57.76376724243164
"if he wants our society, let
him seek it.	40.99508285522461
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr bennet
came from it.	78.9742660522461
during their walk, it was resolved that mr bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	65.44505310058594
she did indeed.	46.852054595947266
no principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy.	87.53358459472656
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.	21.83781623840332
"i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	67.99462127685547
but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."	64.04719543457031
i was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	148.7099151611328
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor."	67.12101745605469
"a man who had felt less, might."	67.26844024658203
the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you.	56.63862228393555
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	21.16958236694336
my sisters may write to _me_.	54.807159423828125
mr darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	63.53617858886719
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	62.30970764160156
said jane.	51.27577209472656
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	56.780487060546875
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.	55.42931365966797
i knew it myself, as
     it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--it is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer.	76.03972625732422
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	41.2014274597168
"yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."	74.61832427978516
their table was superlatively stupid.	57.49951171875
happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!"	54.08530044555664
you know pretty well, i suppose,
     what has been done for the young people.	57.50093460083008
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	67.80242156982422
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	57.62370681762695
"yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."	66.97328186035156
as yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.	59.55195999145508
"i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said darcy.	68.3321304321289
she had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	66.75971984863281
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	53.089969635009766
poor
jane!	65.76809692382812
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	64.3453140258789
when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	61.8712043762207
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	54.50385665893555
the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country.	57.98442459106445
the strangeness of mr collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	48.252349853515625
"mr darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	91.55484771728516
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs
hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	76.64671325683594
i am not equal to it.	48.36143112182617
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	29.404817581176758
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	59.175167083740234
the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.	49.37912368774414
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage.	63.22093963623047
did she call to refuse her consent?"	69.38900756835938
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give.	160.09030151367188
i shall see her in january.	56.65369415283203
"you never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	73.38504028320312
you have employed your
time much better.	63.79960250854492
no, never.	53.580078125
i hope you have destroyed the letter.	43.27052688598633
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	63.25000762939453
"my uncle is to send a servant for us."	57.292327880859375
"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	78.56987762451172
"she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	59.038333892822266
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."	47.60264205932617
it was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	61.79634094238281
the promised
letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	61.904815673828125
"as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	53.33376693725586
you take
delight in vexing me.	139.00941467285156
society, i own, is necessary to me.	135.63351440429688
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"	74.54093933105469
"oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice.	53.230281829833984
put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	45.030826568603516
"i think you said she was a widow, sir?	40.68169021606445
the
rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	62.81455612182617
when i went away, i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again!	70.80223083496094
they soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	82.37417602539062
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's
way."	53.107574462890625
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."	52.75080490112305
they had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	54.3420524597168
i do not know who is
good enough for him."	68.8745346069336
his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	83.35257720947266
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham."	77.85320281982422
having said thus much, i feel no
     doubt of your secrecy.	65.87091064453125
but if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	40.9380989074707
then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
by herself.	70.89334869384766
jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	58.16328430175781
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which mr darcy afterwards discharged.	43.049259185791016
"you have a house in town, i conclude?"	50.126224517822266
they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	73.80496215820312
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.	60.39557647705078
"no, indeed, i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's
connections.	85.990966796875
she had obtained private intelligence that mr
darcy did not wish for cards; and mr hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	75.92755126953125
"oh!	55.182315826416016
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	68.18055725097656
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	41.48565673828125
her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	49.403018951416016
"yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	79.88758850097656
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
with mrs hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
london.	80.59600067138672
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	62.450313568115234
on this subject, what can you have to
say?	81.47348022460938
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"in vain have i struggled.	41.97028350830078
he
is so excessively handsome!	104.0674819946289
all
elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	57.855281829833984
dear me!	45.78740692138672
i cannot
     understand it.	48.99394226074219
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it."	59.13142013549805
i am going to-morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	45.71456527709961
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	51.16106033325195
"she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley.	64.31624603271484
it cannot last long.	78.48959350585938
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."	56.1115837097168
risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."	58.79283142089844
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr bennet, "and
nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.	59.99068069458008
you refuse, then, to oblige me.	56.75017166137695
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	85.44334411621094
mr darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	60.47601318359375
but it was not to be.	44.73812484741211
"for the liveliness of your mind, i did."	63.948081970214844
but these things happen so often!	83.14765930175781
my dear, dear jane, i am so
happy!	29.67923355102539
when mr bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	44.00686264038086
his affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.	45.480194091796875
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	55.560699462890625
i know no harm of her."	39.45940399169922
"this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	89.84855651855469
i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together."	19.813247680664062
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be
placed in the gallery at pemberley.	42.020565032958984
let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay.	98.83345794677734
of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	58.54893112182617
mr bingley arrived.	73.94554901123047
my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	76.83600616455078
as a
child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
temper.	82.29169464111328
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	62.818302154541016
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	50.457618713378906
i have
not the smallest hope.	57.542457580566406
"to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."	56.061092376708984
but
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy mr collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's
praise into his own hands.	32.58427047729492
"if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."	72.89983367919922
this preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	75.96786499023438
a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern.	61.079742431640625
i am
afraid you will be angry."	54.00975036621094
"i am glad i bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	31.917335510253906
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	57.60917282104492
she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	47.90013122558594
"there
is nothing the matter with me.	21.495393753051758
his character is thereby complete."	77.01229858398438
"i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."	53.74057388305664
"that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever
heard you utter.	61.73031234741211
you know my sentiments."	60.57794952392578
it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	65.08716583251953
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	37.05781173706055
mary and kitty, thank
heaven!	64.80819702148438
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.	73.57764434814453
but now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	54.31610870361328
my uncle!"	60.245548248291016
you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	85.8025131225586
while
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	65.27075958251953
they went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	33.15633010864258
"it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	43.08339309692383
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr
wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	53.674564361572266
about a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate;
     and thither also went mr wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs
     younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	231.2267608642578
they are gone off together
from brighton.	54.4095573425293
"what is his name?"	60.58049011230469
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	64.96344757080078
he had to be sure done much.	29.966947555541992
but, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane.	69.22686767578125
mr bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	44.62309265136719
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	48.27423095703125
"what do you mean?"	91.54741668701172
"i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."	67.85958099365234
ten thousand a year!	70.11804962158203
mr bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	58.561607360839844
wherever you and jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly
sisters.	42.6749267578125
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."	67.56550598144531
a report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	62.7602424621582
they are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	60.85363006591797
i hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point."	55.07117462158203
neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach."	60.11836624145508
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
mr collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure."	61.30388641357422
eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	75.20366668701172
let her go then.	54.55350112915039
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!	65.91609191894531
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!	58.832820892333984
you deserve no such attention.	61.14990997314453
"it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began.	28.31834602355957
have a little
compassion on my nerves.	61.12818908691406
bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence.	126.71861267089844
"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said elizabeth.	125.52233123779297
i know it to be impossible."	58.128440856933594
after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	58.802223205566406
she finds miss pope a treasure.	64.21031188964844
his doing so
drew her notice.	88.33313751220703
"i confess," said he, "that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings.	43.241024017333984
this information, however, startled mrs bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.	63.25905227661133
they gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	60.51036834716797
"but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return."	70.0625
there is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, i dare say."	61.7625846862793
"no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton."	68.54973602294922
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	76.04944610595703
jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	26.669675827026367
"you are quite a visit in my debt, mr bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	66.05040740966797
her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr darcy then
was.	66.23491668701172
she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	45.10646438598633
_her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	53.30342102050781
cried mrs bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley!	68.43771362304688
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	54.13814163208008
do not let us
quarrel about the past.	40.86720275878906
people _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
it is not true.	59.66437911987305
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and
lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	57.70916748046875
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	110.63768005371094
"there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?"	50.49852752685547
they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs
bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	64.76824951171875
if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better.	14.238279342651367
both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	49.75006103515625
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr
darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	34.1002197265625
the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.	40.59172058105469
jane shook her head.	50.6128044128418
1.f.1.	48.091487884521484
can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"	86.27505493164062
if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy!	55.6286735534668
but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	64.95130920410156
cried elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.	42.94322204589844
mr collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	224.49749755859375
in every view it
is unaccountable!"	61.553016662597656
mr
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	51.976356506347656
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_."	62.32126998901367
i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	63.28726577758789
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george
wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the
late mr darcy's steward.	22.10423469543457
she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	87.73637390136719
he was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	76.22657775878906
"i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	15.94970703125
said elizabeth.	79.70186614990234
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	65.88890838623047
they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	57.35820770263672
1.e.8.	56.80011749267578
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr darcy.	173.8986358642578
with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	33.89292907714844
in as short a time as mr collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.	40.53664779663086
elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	66.90440368652344
"no.	59.115299224853516
i do not believe she often sees such at home."	51.582847595214844
her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	56.057247161865234
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	67.69856262207031
"to-morrow fortnight."	78.55961608886719
"yes, very different.	68.06195831298828
my fingers wait your orders."	53.579078674316406
"she is a very fine-looking woman!	56.71261978149414
they saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	76.23766326904297
despite these efforts, project gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.	74.86944580078125
but i
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london.	45.49559020996094
i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, i should not pay him half so much deference.	60.5105094909668
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	69.3408203125
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	159.3322296142578
"i will not be interrupted.	53.55610656738281
to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	61.295291900634766
"i am," said he, with a firm voice.	54.901851654052734
now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?	56.01772689819336
i should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	45.79928970336914
said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	46.72447967529297
mr darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	61.5823974609375
she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	78.23345184326172
"no, nothing at all."	65.54615783691406
he is gone to my father already.	55.146751403808594
"of music!	58.072967529296875
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!	52.65367889404297
mrs bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	103.47208404541016
you may imagine what i felt
     and how i acted.	53.62023162841797
but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	69.41836547851562
"lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room."	53.79209518432617
"you are over scrupulous surely.	47.8280143737793
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	79.91577911376953
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you
joy?"	91.15011596679688
if you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday
     se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as
     lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day.	63.41349792480469
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr wickham.	64.60541534423828
but
nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done.	72.8343734741211
redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.	61.82784652709961
i need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	106.7236557006836
he will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."	84.58839416503906
how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?	56.94686508178711
"what could he mean?	73.761474609375
in three volumes.	69.01214599609375
"well, so much the better.	22.10423469543457
if i
had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
him.	80.47335815429688
but the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."	60.765708923339844
he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	44.50837707519531
said elizabeth.	40.827056884765625
and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is
the usual price of an earl's younger son?	51.923728942871094
"well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	74.93098449707031
"i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring.	119.12544250488281
"what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	53.05498123168945
for god's sake, say no more of
his partners.	88.92047119140625
i must conclude, for i cannot be
     long from my poor mother.	313.1441345214844
mamma, do the
people here abouts know i am married to-day?	92.29685974121094
"upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	69.3921127319336
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	66.68406677246094
"complied with!	119.0477066040039
this was agreed to, and mrs philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	88.43753814697266
you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	46.99009704589844
and, above all things, keep mr bennet from
fighting.	145.47911071777344
how are they even to be discovered?	36.77895736694336
it distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
parsonage.	50.252201080322266
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	75.72966003417969
all loveliness and goodness as she is!	46.53336715698242
i had not an idea of it."	82.6935043334961
in that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	74.78028869628906
_i_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	54.87452697753906
mrs bennet, we shall have her
at netherfield at last.'	50.4018440246582
how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!	54.768890380859375
and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	51.360164642333984
"mr collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	115.5403060913086
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"	53.277503967285156
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.	59.14151382446289
from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr
collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed.	63.62051773071289
i
am sure my sisters must all envy me.	82.44384765625
"in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	73.80496215820312
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	48.071510314941406
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.	55.682064056396484
but she is nothing to me now.	69.09901428222656
"oh!	61.075809478759766
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	56.423622131347656
but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"	84.12140655517578
he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	57.85699462890625
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	58.91622543334961
a few days after this visit, mr bingley called again, and alone.	120.17230987548828
do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.	68.56385803222656
the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.	52.85393142700195
it was dated
from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.	58.805416107177734
perhaps he thought her too young.	60.58967590332031
mr darcy danced
only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	65.43245697021484
"he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"	58.224945068359375
there is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town.	53.05180358886719
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness.	96.04010009765625
you and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, mr bingley might like you the best of the
party."	52.62718200683594
in the former were many good paintings;
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	43.88484573364258
a great deal more passed at the
other table.	89.56982421875
after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.	73.20511627197266
she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	98.18345642089844
he now wished it more than ever.	68.3298110961914
elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	83.58465576171875
but
these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	86.4352798461914
now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	66.81880187988281
she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	68.19791412353516
i will speak to her about it myself directly.	47.16352081298828
"i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.	76.53569030761719
elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.	64.94557189941406
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	72.17848205566406
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.	65.51656341552734
as a clergyman, moreover, i
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	62.68341064453125
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	37.50782775878906
the compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	74.97547912597656
"the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting.	78.08363342285156
"now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy.	73.80496215820312
your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	87.84970092773438
your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	74.64525604248047
a flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	46.351749420166016
"oh!	55.22216796875
mrs collins knew not what to make of him.	67.06352996826172
"what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!"	58.8092041015625
"yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	86.03475952148438
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	65.08995819091797
it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham.	79.98661804199219
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
at all."	55.094337463378906
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"	37.90636444091797
but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will
take it on myself."	62.061668395996094
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy,
"of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.	46.10701370239258
"go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	111.17052459716797
but that is one great difference between
us.	111.92987823486328
elizabeth was delighted.	170.7093048095703
he merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."	63.17648696899414
"if one could but go to brighton!"	58.23102569580078
but are you pleased,
jane?	42.81108474731445
it was really a very
handsome thought.	70.94109344482422
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	63.50840377807617
pray forgive
     me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
     have been all round the park.	89.10124206542969
my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."	54.57876968383789
it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	48.57637023925781
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr darcy's having both spent three
weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	51.19415283203125
it was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	109.72084045410156
elizabeth
was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	90.89452362060547
"well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	86.10884094238281
"heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me
such an evil."	58.4499626159668
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	89.28378295898438
i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say.	48.100677490234375
the sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	105.9415512084961
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	42.88734817504883
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed.	58.78113555908203
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her.	73.7496566772461
"this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune!	48.438541412353516
mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not
return it.	76.28409576416016
she longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to
jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.	62.68947982788086
"no, indeed.	73.89978790283203
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful."	47.52238845825195
"indeed, mr collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	68.69947814941406
his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
mr darcy with a very expressive smile.	98.1243896484375
"are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"	57.49470520019531
"you are then resolved to have him?"	38.85015106201172
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of mr bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	93.94955444335938
she felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.	62.88228225708008
they look upon it
quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens."	50.185585021972656
"can i have the carriage?"	49.75006103515625
he promises fairly, and i hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent.	72.17400360107422
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	64.79376220703125
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	53.56529998779297
1.b.	41.92463684082031
she could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	50.912696838378906
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c. are
sufficiently known.	50.719844818115234
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	35.512229919433594
he shall not be in love with me, if i
can prevent it."	48.61359405517578
elizabeth replied that it was.	62.59637451171875
"not that i _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."	53.83504867553711
"what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr
darcy had much better finish his letter."	73.36376953125
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	77.47284698486328
she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	53.59776306152344
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
not rest till i knew the particulars.	61.164730072021484
"believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	58.76446533203125
it was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	73.80496215820312
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states.	57.25592803955078
"all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."	94.6490249633789
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	76.88754272460938
"oh!	76.90245819091797
she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."	118.43801879882812
this son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	87.6196060180664
it exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.	53.867286682128906
"is it not clear enough?--does it not expressly declare
that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means most kindly!	45.88325500488281
"can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	66.12064361572266
sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	75.05882263183594
but the gentlemen will have mr bingley's chaise to go to meryton;
and the hursts have no horses to theirs."	66.7564697265625
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet, and
mrs hurst was observing their game.	62.731666564941406
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	53.34335708618164
"and that," said mrs reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.	89.74913024902344
not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.	58.41655349731445
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure
you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do.	48.54957580566406
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	61.33195877075195
brother-in-law of wickham!	48.039337158203125
he took the hint,
and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"that will do extremely well, child.	69.71537780761719
she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	66.09832763671875
mrs bennet was not in the
habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	61.074527740478516
i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly.	54.1864128112793
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
think it is well expressed."	78.95755004882812
"and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?"	57.066078186035156
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.	96.16832733154297
this was one point, with
regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	68.79814910888672
he was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_
a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.'	56.879695892333984
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too!	179.63328552246094
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	52.85752487182617
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson; did not
i mention it to you?	59.06669235229492
he could even
listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st. james's, with very decent composure.	31.858869552612305
how i laughed!	58.79058837890625
thought she.	72.99781799316406
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr darcy.	69.44266510009766
"how strange!"	57.41630172729492
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a
lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr darcy, drawing near
elizabeth, said to her--

"do not you feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"	47.08194351196289
his consenting to marry
her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	101.64076232910156
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner's hope of lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	50.74703598022461
she seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.	52.05244827270508
his temptation is
not adequate to the risk."	81.0149154663086
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	38.100215911865234
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.	63.36806869506836
mrs bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	41.69440460205078
but vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	22.404823303222656
i shall go distracted."	80.7685546875
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	63.800086975097656
give my love to colonel forster, i hope you
     will drink to our good journey.	28.189563751220703
he was very fond of them."	68.75977325439453
he
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	59.594966888427734
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.	107.28802490234375
cried elizabeth.	53.606990814208984
if i have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured mr wickham, i can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family.	40.86164855957031
when a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."	54.538734436035156
no look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	57.33272171020508
"yes, indeed," cried mrs bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	70.26963806152344
mr collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs bennet.	56.72846603393555
elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	72.62604522705078
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr
hurst had a house.	65.71865844726562
but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem.	51.31272888183594
at night she opened her heart to jane.	54.281944274902344
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	44.99339294433594
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"jane, i congratulate you.	64.33319854736328
but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	76.52799224853516
contact the
foundation as set forth in section 3 below.	86.12129211425781
"nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	70.85701751708984
"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."	51.290950775146484
he
then said,

"i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.	43.64411163330078
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	64.77886962890625

"why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."	60.06306457519531
mrs bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	60.6993293762207
"i see no occasion for that.	58.873985290527344
this letter is from mr collins."	73.38703155517578
"i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	45.33434295654297
"my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?"	49.737884521484375
"it must have been his sister's doing.	51.28529739379883
with a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	75.1444091796875
it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	63.80751037597656
she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	63.8013916015625
her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of mr darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	63.52409362792969
"well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?	99.51309204101562
her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.	59.85238265991211
"you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	53.168678283691406
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"let me call your maid.	74.20813751220703
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	85.16159057617188
"i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	468.50311279296875

the letter was to this
effect:

     "my dear lizzy,

     "i wish you joy.	73.80496215820312
the lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	59.56743621826172
"if!	47.26853561401367
"miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	47.21217727661133
"oh!	62.26254653930664
however, i
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for mr darcy might have done as well."	59.09903335571289
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	35.608619689941406
from
what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	66.74132537841797
"what do you mean, hill?	54.51055145263672
mr darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life!	41.64419174194336
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
saw any thing of it.	58.3164176940918
he has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."	61.57053756713867
an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.	55.324954986572266
yet, indeed, i am
in earnest.	39.59657669067383
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.	71.52938079833984
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	57.88945007324219
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	62.202274322509766
but georgiana would not join
her.	75.99905395507812
his surprise was great.	50.837032318115234
"i have heard much of your master's fine person," said mrs gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	56.31296920776367
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"did not you think, mr darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?"	76.64532470703125
for the last week they had seen very little
of either lady catherine or her daughter.	91.57081604003906
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	74.48262786865234
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
mr bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st. james's.	53.67852020263672
and it was not wholly without foundation.	63.35676956176758
the day passed much as the day before had done.	69.37239837646484
and so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	76.18689727783203
no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	16.20591163635254
at present i am not in love with
mr wickham; no, i certainly am not.	72.4233627319336
mr wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed.	48.44036102294922
i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	122.71967315673828
cried lydia.	75.1006088256836
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	62.94156265258789
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.	66.99324798583984
"oh, lord!	63.446563720703125
and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	50.6246452331543
thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."	61.77235794067383
the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	47.311405181884766
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.	67.17108917236328
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.	66.80347442626953
they were, therefore, to go.--elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	71.30989074707031
mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	43.93805694580078
"books--oh!	84.53303527832031
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	63.95579147338867
"what will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are!	59.522804260253906
additional terms will be linked
to the project gutenberg-tm license for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.	157.9393310546875
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	52.610286712646484
there was no arguing upon such a project.	79.05052185058594
she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	52.030242919921875
and so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?	44.642051696777344
wickham only shook his head.	50.291038513183594
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	76.05143737792969
every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	49.041015625
we have not met since the 26th of november, when
we were all dancing together at netherfield."	76.4349136352539
i do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	45.439937591552734
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	101.75574493408203
the prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	78.37960052490234
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	67.31576538085938
i was uncomfortable enough.	49.7534294128418
i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	63.9522590637207
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself."	55.10078048706055
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.	68.22179412841797
every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.	39.86509323120117
"care of him!--yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care.	56.92375946044922
she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	54.64101791381836
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	79.86941528320312
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	47.409568786621094
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	56.90174865722656
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	51.07029342651367
and i think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.	48.80144500732422
i had not
believed it possible."	75.59321594238281
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland.	64.01810455322266
she had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	69.8978271484375
"a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	49.88724136352539
"have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?	98.6370849609375
"that is right.--you could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.	87.8271713256836
the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	44.721256256103516
with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted!	47.181949615478516
"blame you!	69.86620330810547
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	76.43072509765625
_i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	75.52136993408203
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at brighton.	43.405555725097656
"perfectly so--i thank you."	32.43445587158203
well!	51.118507385253906
this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	58.27883529663086
their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	61.971439361572266
till this moment, i never knew myself."	61.633689880371094

but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	93.22260284423828
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	81.59221649169922
the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	50.0616340637207
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir
william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.	59.921348571777344
far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	74.31710052490234
her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	37.49403762817383
younger sons cannot marry
where they like."	64.58684539794922
the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.	65.1766128540039
one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.	67.20524597167969
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	51.46563720703125
"oh, yes.	36.372920989990234
my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	48.94196319580078
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	59.64258575439453
lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention.	95.21027374267578
miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	67.03257751464844
she liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	67.44186401367188
miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	53.01188659667969
my sweetest lizzy!	49.95280456542969
but, on second thoughts,
perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."	48.998863220214844
lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard,
and if he does, colonel forster will hire him.	55.92521667480469
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."	65.78004455566406
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr collins
very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	64.39596557617188
he is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.	69.10138702392578
but there
are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am
ever to pay him."	80.93043518066406
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	88.96283721923828
his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative.	54.85383224487305
it is every way horrible!"	70.92627716064453
"it is no such thing.	87.53922271728516
one came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	55.818809509277344
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	51.639320373535156
she had a sister married to a mr philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade.	45.66544723510742
but i have
other provocations.	100.012451171875
he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you
cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	36.76576232910156
during dinner, mr bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	114.73627471923828
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	102.86634063720703
"why will you think so?	81.95359802246094
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	41.80305862426758

it was all
     over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been.	58.427364349365234
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	48.90760040283203
cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted.	46.97746276855469
there can be no love in all this.	40.72029113769531
had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	72.30428314208984
i am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	65.08856201171875
mr collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	66.58356475830078
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	66.6168441772461
what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received!	61.33622360229492
sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine."	68.48550415039062
"you either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire."	52.783565521240234
"_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.	73.50794219970703
his regiment is there; for i suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	39.90409851074219
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	64.84825897216797
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	53.95870590209961
mr
     darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	63.39542007446289
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	55.1153678894043
i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	67.6616439819336
he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure
_i_ never want to see him again.	60.37548065185547
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."	77.90148162841797
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	76.13336181640625
"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	50.437049865722656
in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	79.3517074584961
with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"	60.75267028808594
his revenge would have been complete indeed.	38.99592590332031
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.	158.74435424804688
they battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved.	52.11795425415039
i was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr darcy.	52.93299102783203
"yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	84.33297729492188
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking.	72.62126922607422
in the absence of jane,
he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	99.25204467773438
it is highly improper.	58.72239303588867
at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs hurst and
elizabeth herself.	74.85491943359375
vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	71.30284881591797
why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	99.38473510742188
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all mr collins's scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that mr wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	53.96625518798828
i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention;
the other is charlotte's marriage.	50.82332992553711
mr collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	81.87263488769531
mr darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	58.707332611083984
after this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	39.88975524902344
mr collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	75.55497741699219
mr collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	60.393043518066406
my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	47.9368896484375
i know you will contrive it all."	54.22359848022461
never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her.	23.580799102783203
but before they heard again from mr gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from mr collins; which, as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	71.92539978027344
nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	46.551021575927734
a person may be
proud without being vain.	60.68515396118164
mr collins!"	53.66262435913086
"that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	68.43278503417969
i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	47.18867111206055
human nature is so prone to
fall into it!	52.30257034301758
"to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	102.34127044677734
he has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."	65.83759307861328
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."	28.314416885375977
presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	41.160919189453125
the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	48.067508697509766
much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going
to be married.	61.13796615600586
i _will_ leave him to himself."	48.850337982177734
that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.	37.54865264892578
you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."	98.3055419921875
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	63.18781280517578
"yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	56.976654052734375
_that_ abominable mr darcy!--my father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.	18.877836227416992
the whole family in short
were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	60.84379196166992
"no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	84.22785186767578
it will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."	83.79524230957031
how could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"	83.61307525634766
they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr
bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.	61.902095794677734
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is
impossible.	144.28897094726562
"did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	41.15850830078125
multiple
      superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets
      example: m^{rs}.	50.95708084106445
she enquired into charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	45.03941345214844
"good heaven!	44.949615478515625
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	38.75382995605469
mrs
bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger!	40.959266662597656
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	49.77503967285156
she is
not such a simpleton.	104.79266357421875
"and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters."	58.1829833984375
mr wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	70.8995361328125
his air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	58.127464294433594
this cannot be!	104.0688247680664
pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.	58.490055084228516
in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to mr darcy were by no means over.	62.345584869384766
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	68.3386459350586
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	42.72883605957031
"i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have
not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	315.8759765625
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"	76.53010559082031
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	60.62675857543945
lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr
collins first came to hunsford."	47.939964294433594
"how so?	71.08203125
i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	68.91700744628906
five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing.	64.82308959960938
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	66.9300537109375
they were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities.	69.92269897460938
if _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	20.972673416137695

you shall hear what she says."	51.790313720703125
your idea of the ponies is delightful.	74.1084213256836
there was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	67.4550552368164
i have faults enough,
but they are not, i hope, of understanding.	59.24849319458008
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame.	70.3769760131836
he takes them now for people of
fashion."	78.64102172851562
"i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london.	64.64301300048828
she remembered also, that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr
darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	82.30432891845703
you must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say.	59.65481948852539
"i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."	50.37068176269531
i am very glad
you liked her.	83.62806701660156
mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	56.01029586791992
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	45.247684478759766
his sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	65.53961944580078
one must speak a little, you know.	89.15904235839844
"_that_ is a failing indeed!"	44.9493293762207
nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	79.61592102050781
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	60.79460906982422
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	57.27492904663086
i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	124.76312255859375
"he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	48.800880432128906
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.	44.68388748168945
it became her turn to listen.	69.94287109375
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	43.39152526855469
your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."	44.498775482177734
that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	62.243309020996094
elizabeth felt jane's
pleasure.	62.080074310302734
but perhaps mr bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."	51.05998229980469
let me hear
     from you very soon.	56.146915435791016
miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	65.41024017333984
my kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till i am better.	62.7523193359375
i must confess myself
     surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.	70.48748016357422
though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was
her, i would not have put up with it.	58.39680862426758
they came.	89.07804870605469
thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
assure you there are many amiable young women.	49.19694519042969
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	63.97473907470703
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	43.83720016479492
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	288.9176025390625
mr darcy!--and so it does i vow.	200.05990600585938
she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	35.781158447265625
what do i not
owe you!	118.06568908691406
"hate you!	35.90207290649414
how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!	48.25297546386719
elizabeth, equally
next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	61.69599533081055
special rules,
set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark.	49.75006103515625
he has heartily forgiven me
now."	66.50531005859375
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.	85.15582275390625
1.e.4.	57.009891510009766
as a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him!	61.583248138427734
"this is an evening of wonders, indeed!	44.74322509765625
"how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!	96.80937957763672
and then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.	60.418128967285156
but that is not the
case _here_.	46.46153259277344
he is come--mr bingley is
come.--he is, indeed.	64.35870361328125
"did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	65.5536880493164
my aunt told me so
herself on saturday.	28.028507232666016
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	53.994930267333984
"but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."	52.4115104675293
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him."	55.51810836791992
mrs bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
mr bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	49.732154846191406
darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
consented.	33.51571273803711
the fee is
     owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     project gutenberg literary archive foundation.	92.62849426269531
it is impossible that he should still love
me."	55.46416473388672
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."	64.55284881591797
the distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	72.13471221923828
"i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.	66.08250427246094
poor dear
child!	39.228267669677734
no thanks to his gallantry for that.	41.01426315307617
four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	49.913414001464844
mrs gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	106.1988525390625
"certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	58.42393493652344
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
we shall do."	53.26480484008789
"a man who has once been refused!	75.74959564208984
you may depend upon my seeking no further."	86.45295715332031
that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	48.085357666015625
the foundation's principal office is located at 4557 melan dr. s.
fairbanks, ak, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.	69.64769744873047
the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	41.61805725097656
by nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at st. james's had made him
courteous.	49.00298309326172
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	29.62578582763672
there are a few
things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	66.21773529052734
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	66.12764739990234
my sister, i am
sure, will not hear of her removal."	59.888694763183594
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister!	83.1966781616211
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.	56.544986724853516
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.	36.8913459777832
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	58.702518463134766
and
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	93.1529312133789
said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with."	67.36203002929688
but jane and elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	41.765113830566406
"our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."	58.674503326416016
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.	89.7300796508789
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard."	39.78528594970703
if you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	65.02183532714844
"my dear sir," replied mr collins, "i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	64.72570037841797
wont it, kitty?"	50.04792785644531
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from caroline.	47.93643569946289
"oh, yes!--he was to come there with wickham, you know.	70.4646224975586
your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--if it be so, if i have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.	68.97602081298828
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	32.89371109008789
kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; by the bye, mrs forster and me are _such_ friends!	59.82890319824219
"i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a
kingdom!	37.57017517089844
cried miss bingley.	37.558475494384766
ring the bell,
kitty, for hill.	44.36318588256836
but you are always giving _her_ the
preference."	72.68611907958984
"yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	51.442909240722656
"already arisen!"	42.1088752746582
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	44.359779357910156
they had frequently been staying with her in town.	75.51971435546875
does he
know his real character?"	90.55648040771484
"yes--if darcy does not put it off again.	70.53057098388672
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as i certainly did."	50.417381286621094
her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	55.63570022583008
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	47.82392120361328
is not it so, mrs bennet?"	167.2114715576172
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"	66.63955688476562
she had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.	47.081111907958984
what news?	65.86634826660156
only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	58.29384231567383
"as soon as ever mr bingley comes, my dear," said mrs bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."	27.980749130249023
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- you pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of project gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.	48.68021774291992
every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.	51.545387268066406
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king.	42.04597473144531
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.	83.44332122802734
"i have, sir."	62.88650894165039
"i am sure i shall break _mine_," said lydia.	76.53569030761719
and with no one to speak to, of what i
felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had!	46.3761100769043
what
could be more natural than his asking you again?	71.82354736328125
these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	57.75410079956055
"pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."	70.32682800292969
she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	156.67855834960938
he had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	60.97620391845703
"your affectionate friend,

     "lydia bennet."	49.89557647705078
mrs wickham!	86.57585144042969
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	38.93632125854492
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without
calling her attention.	51.231895446777344
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	56.282981872558594
take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.	63.007591247558594
they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."	63.7010498046875
"you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.	63.97754669189453
you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	72.60406494140625
"i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.	73.48480224609375
her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	76.37873840332031
he who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	39.96806716918945
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	55.449745178222656
and this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace.	69.91169738769531
i think i have heard you say that you know them."	54.88093566894531
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for jane.	64.684326171875
so much the better.	56.06338882446289
and what can _he_ have to say?"	106.7236557006836
that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	55.44855880737305
i have no such injuries to resent.	133.1743621826172
in three volumes.	45.37834548950195
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."	60.4777946472168
i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!	50.84098815917969
miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr darcy looked
up.	53.08848571777344
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	55.09439468383789
this was not very consoling to mrs bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	65.87298583984375
"indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	136.7928924560547
"my dear mr bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	65.43111419677734
"aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had
known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	89.3694839477539
and do you
really love him quite well enough?	40.867984771728516
mr robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	56.03377914428711
and so extremely
accomplished for her age!	79.03385925292969
"yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside."	52.17618942260742
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins,
and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy."	64.32942962646484
elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.	100.04841613769531
mr collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	51.566314697265625
i
hope he will overlook it.	40.09925842285156
the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	65.06118774414062
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	80.98741912841797
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
together.	57.4582633972168
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers."	60.54130554199219
if there _were_ but
such another man for you!"	56.3364372253418
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once.	36.713478088378906
"aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."	58.032779693603516
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	44.945953369140625
--a
short pause followed this speech, and mrs hurst began again.	65.56947326660156
she resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	51.70401382446289
how shall i bear so much happiness!"	49.753822326660156
i
shall now know how to act.	137.68228149414062
her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.	22.65777587890625
elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.	30.435937881469727
"had you then persuaded yourself that i should?"	33.73897171020508
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	58.0728874206543
"and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."	25.65711212158203
you will be a very happy woman."	95.08646392822266
but against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	56.560298919677734
"is it possible!"	41.52315902709961
he was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	59.70803451538086
how could i
     be so silly as to wish it!	63.544715881347656
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.	67.94395446777344
"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr darcy!--there
is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."	70.7494888305664
charlotte the wife of mr collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	58.609352111816406
"it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	63.30775833129883
it was a rational scheme to be sure!	60.779388427734375
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	10.309560775756836
i quite detest the man."	33.295345306396484
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance.	41.094703674316406
oh!	63.56292724609375
this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."	37.915836334228516
mr bennet could not have chosen
better.	61.415977478027344
my dear jane, i am in
such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you
write for me.	60.77920913696289
"yes; he introduced us to his sister."	69.97853088378906
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	73.63056945800781
"i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful."	31.187829971313477
i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."	60.03992462158203
the period of expectation was now doubled.	81.37039947509766
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	30.322948455810547
lady catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr
darcy.	57.66097640991211

you
mentioned _two_ instances.	61.66094207763672
and if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	80.46548461914062
"john told us mr darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	65.33972930908203
but no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	64.36732482910156
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	74.71444702148438
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	61.72733688354492
but i must tell you how it went off.	72.59356689453125
i wish you had been there.	72.3531494140625
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	75.12137603759766
she turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	21.821653366088867
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, mrs gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	64.07554626464844
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	64.91260528564453
"certainly not."	57.869937896728516
elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	62.65409851074219
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady
catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	49.33269119262695
"no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.	70.13834381103516
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	58.09324264526367
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,"
said he.	80.72785949707031
her own thoughts were employing her.	67.31261444091797
it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	41.04131317138672
"project gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	58.66630554199219
now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

"mr darcy, i am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding your's.	53.02498245239258
let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	49.873355865478516
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me.	52.95894241333008
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear.	41.59029769897461
as to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.	56.10893630981445
she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	160.92108154296875
"i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley's conduct to design,"
said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	48.382137298583984
"certainly.	53.97050094604492
1813.	56.53550338745117
what is it you are talking
of?	66.72067260742188
recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	69.16114044189453
i have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, i should think you could not do better.	49.75006103515625
"to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding, than i now do of her heart.	41.12504577636719
my dear brother," replied mrs bennet, "that is exactly what i
could most wish for.	70.35047149658203
i am not qualified to form one.	51.56470489501953
1.f.5.	69.54568481445312
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter.	59.433040618896484
it is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."	59.071475982666016
my dear, dear
lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!"	34.626434326171875
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did.	24.891759872436523
"mrs annesley is with her.	77.7403564453125
a thousand things may arise in six months!"	61.399139404296875
i know how much
you dislike him."	50.7947998046875
very well.	70.53716278076172
"how i long to see her again!	46.45746612548828
he sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	43.30161666870117
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	104.87679290771484
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see mr darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	50.71414566040039
it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."	56.2232666015625
at last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with
great perseverance.	124.76996612548828
my poor father!	61.65965270996094
but with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
chance of it."	60.20620346069336
when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	63.34214782714844
elizabeth could not but look surprised.	64.41236114501953
in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.	62.343441009521484
but i know the
foundation is unjust.	47.00726318359375
"oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"	85.74913787841797
"a great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	62.29230499267578
they are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."	77.3177261352539
this
unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at pemberley to-day."	167.01370239257812
"well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.	52.746238708496094
she began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	54.59356689453125
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	96.75238800048828
"no, no.	46.318702697753906
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said
elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	72.55294799804688
she wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country."	56.106475830078125
"that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	88.42833709716797
"i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."	45.34744644165039
to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	25.775211334228516
it drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	82.37068939208984
"true.	68.7917251586914
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."	60.238975524902344
will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"	57.575477600097656
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	34.70832824707031
_too
much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	63.56987380981445
elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.	72.36015319824219
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	64.59823608398438
"what can be the meaning of this!"	73.00328826904297
elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	84.67423248291016
lady catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	56.01617431640625
at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!	58.11540985107422
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	33.1574592590332
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	95.84471893310547
"indeed, mr bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"	51.35885238647461
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	50.19896697998047
but i must write no more.	44.14408493041992
not that
i care about it, though.	64.22108459472656
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "mr bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	78.68595886230469
assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	59.030853271484375
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	114.68119049072266
"he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	88.35735321044922
the two youngest of the family,
catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.	46.462371826171875
darcy,
as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	77.59103393554688
who should suffer but myself?	58.078369140625
"this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said
elizabeth.	81.9027328491211
"i never can be thankful, mr bennet, for any thing about the entail.	67.81632995605469
but think no more of the letter.	61.135833740234375
however, i did not hear above one word in ten,
for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.	70.30057525634766
this is my advice.	26.901142120361328
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	63.51881790161133
they could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for mr darcy.	65.03904724121094
i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	85.61055755615234
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity.	44.757877349853516
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	70.27172088623047
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.	125.85028839111328
lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.	42.31061935424805
but really, and upon my
honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you
are satisfied."	77.47125244140625
there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	87.22080993652344
it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	18.217811584472656
but every body is to
judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i
assure you.	48.74876403808594
with the kindest concern he
     came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart.	73.43862915039062
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	46.93461608886719
--cried elizabeth.	64.9348373413086
"how nicely we are crammed in!"	53.33010482788086
"well, and what news does it bring?	37.03226089477539
"yes, yes, they must marry.	48.93381881713867
follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, i own, and i
laugh at them whenever i can.--but these, i suppose, are precisely what
you are without."	61.83020782470703
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	61.030338287353516
are any of your
younger sisters out, miss bennet?"	72.066162109375
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn, before she told her sister of mr darcy's proposals.	62.096004486083984
"no, she would go home.	50.414764404296875
elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	64.10562133789062
i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.	52.963417053222656

i see the imprudence
of it.--oh!	55.396785736083984
if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	67.4656753540039
balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	52.669857025146484
they have some of the finest woods in the
country."	71.30740356445312
as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	41.659732818603516
the very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	60.88215255737305
arguments are too much like disputes.	63.07375717163086
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."	39.95890808105469
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	37.83919143676758
but it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."	83.57672119140625
they repulsed
every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr collins, who was complimenting mr bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	49.356727600097656
elizabeth could bear it no longer.	64.61064910888672
"he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam.	80.15281677246094
"nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair.	67.73724365234375
"you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	50.710601806640625
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."	63.677547454833984
"with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it."	54.794151306152344
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire.	43.3375358581543
if an
individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are
located in the united states, we do not claim a right to prevent you from

so
genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every
body.--_that_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."	61.49953079223633
it soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	54.85563659667969
"and they are really to be married!"	53.17509841918945
it was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	80.84280395507812
her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	44.03754425048828
vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!	68.6278076171875
"my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."	75.16544342041016
teazing, teazing, man!	57.17926025390625
how much you
must have gone through!"	41.90534210205078
while in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family!	61.0631103515625
darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right.	59.588863372802734
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth.	64.58940124511719
"is my father in town?"	43.00536346435547
she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	100.37683868408203
said miss bingley; "will
she be as tall as i am?"	49.52091979980469
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	58.59434127807617
he was silent.	57.25087356567383
he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.	33.13243103027344
there is a lady, it seems, a
     mrs younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.	52.96583557128906
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"	51.14508056640625
tell him i hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	77.6253433227539
i do not deserve it.	54.493892669677734
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness."	35.040531158447266
occupied in observing mr bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.	91.06124114990234
i am prodigiously proud of him.	49.43122482299805
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	57.0828742980957
oh, that i knew how it was!"	69.399658203125
"of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	43.86735534667969
"no, i should have turned in a moment."	89.71434783935547
it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	33.06490707397461
but not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	62.49407958984375
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	91.88245391845703
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
jane certainly could not come back.	41.58182907104492
you see how continually we are engaged there.	79.84029388427734
i have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--not that i have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.	89.20913696289062
all field sports were over.	63.56229019165039
"my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request.	72.666748046875
she cried.--"i, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--i, who have valued myself on my abilities!	70.87299346923828
she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr collins
instead!	56.37784957885742
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	56.9857063293457
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	27.231889724731445
"my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	80.29974365234375
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.	52.53811264038086
supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin?	73.28202056884766
women fancy admiration means more than
it does."	60.390132904052734
she could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	40.8396110534668
it is evident that you belong to the
first circles.	94.1660385131836
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall i own that i long for your return?	68.80034637451172
kitty, run down and order the carriage.	64.88128662109375
"but how did he account for
it?"	81.92577362060547
the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	53.83700180053711
what do
you keep winking at me for?	48.652156829833984
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	61.79798889160156
i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.	64.01428985595703
"lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	59.7573356628418
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	64.94031524658203
"but it is," returned she; "for mrs long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."	54.20036697387695
"mr
collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	71.84156799316406
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	56.78773880004883
for
     about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation.	45.819610595703125
she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	44.71986770629883
the supposition did not pain her.	65.88592529296875
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam.	65.1220932006836
"now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said mr bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	73.59564971923828
his belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	76.43192291259766
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	96.15907287597656
elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	54.91965866088867
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	55.878334045410156
but do you
always write such charming long letters to her, mr darcy?"	45.2822151184082
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley.	102.91515350341797
i _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.	48.40632629394531
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation "the foundation"
or pglaf, owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project
gutenberg-tm electronic works.	27.31673240661621
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	52.83397674560547
do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	55.66501998901367
"my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london."	52.97105407714844
"i hope not."	60.424957275390625
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.	59.59885787963867
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton.	52.00092697143555
the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield.	66.34153747558594
the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	93.14991760253906
it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	47.3366813659668
elizabeth was distressed.	51.98231887817383
with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise
full.--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	71.1519546508789
you know i have.	62.469051361083984
"his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."	86.89398193359375
"aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."	51.852664947509766
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth:

     "my dearest lizzy,

     "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	52.39390563964844
they found mr bennet still up.	61.36817169189453
his pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."	67.14313507080078
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.	67.43939971923828
then addressing her daughter, "oh!	73.64462280273438
the more i see
of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	55.06721496582031
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	88.56084442138672
the insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would
i give to hear your strictures on them!"	47.531368255615234
"i am
sorry it went off.	66.07048034667969
"and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me!	50.385440826416016
could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	36.837318420410156
she was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	53.32124328613281
"haye-park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
too far off!	62.97752380371094
you shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	60.87916946411133
i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_.	73.80496215820312
and even mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.	75.6401596069336
it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	67.3782958984375
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	57.40222930908203
"oh!	42.591609954833984
they were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something!	63.990177154541016
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	73.2916030883789
but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	63.80684280395508
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and
the children.	45.02995681762695
elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	48.2604866027832
he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
lucases.	70.28760528564453
--it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	77.66194915771484
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.	59.2860221862793
it was mr collins's picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	52.389373779296875
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."	51.69892120361328
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	53.77119064331055
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him."	76.82051086425781
"really, mr collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	54.26459503173828
that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	41.750370025634766
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	55.200714111328125
"my dear niece,

     "i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as i foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what i have to tell you.	57.159332275390625
colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr darcy they had
only seen at church.	37.650325775146484
is nothing due to me on that
score?	65.4445571899414
sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	89.11300659179688
mrs bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	40.63922119140625
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	56.74039840698242
mr collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library, he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him, and
lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose fordyce's sermons.	79.77445220947266
no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both.	47.91859817504883
"i dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	73.51953125
"this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	77.66454315185547
limited right of replacement or refund - if you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.	51.00339126586914
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	42.08860778808594
his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	52.9842414855957
i
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, i am thus rejected.	50.415470123291016
it is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
     think of us.	30.699813842773438
those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."	86.64337158203125
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy.	62.436859130859375
he seldom appeared really
animated.	64.44290161132812
but it is of small importance."	53.35750198364258
what an agreeable man sir
william is, mr bingley--is not he?	75.7558822631836
he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	55.137603759765625
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"	63.63686752319336
"if your master would marry, you might see more of him."	46.730709075927734
my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	37.654518127441406
mr darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	68.10721588134766
i was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	95.81108856201172
--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	72.14778137207031
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country.	64.7266616821289
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"	55.43671417236328
what a contrast between him and his friend!	64.20252990722656
only look at her.	64.81122589111328
but little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	79.11553192138672
"yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	10.309560775756836
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.f.3, this work is provided to you 'as-is', with no other
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose.	65.730224609375
they shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	32.69818878173828
what are you telling miss bennet?	95.95166778564453
oh!	56.68974685668945
"having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	45.78389358520508
cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?"	48.27281951904297
"you look pale.	37.342159271240234
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	82.7984619140625
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.	51.763099670410156
poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	63.765445709228516
she went on.	87.48922729492188
i
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes.	32.828216552734375
if there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
miss de bourgh.	78.14632415771484
but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is.	60.3142204284668
she was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.	64.02628326416016
"mr darcy!"	63.4448356628418
the moral will be perfectly fair.	61.07423400878906
she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."	68.67376708984375
"upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	80.94127655029297
he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.	54.70119094848633
as her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	72.79156494140625
she
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	76.77850341796875
"beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	41.67935562133789
"i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	42.699615478515625
for forty years, he produced and distributed project
gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	60.18121337890625
"you are mistaken.	59.66764831542969
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	61.658443450927734
mr
darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	69.27333068847656
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	70.18775939941406
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	40.298072814941406
the
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	72.7319564819336
almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	125.18510437011719
they were off saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight.	45.41328048706055
we seem to have been designed for each
other."	53.967350006103516
i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	32.53825378417969
such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	63.09336853027344
as the day of his arrival drew near,

"i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister.	32.84597396850586
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that mr darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself.	56.163841247558594
we acted with the best intentions."	88.5658187866211
"i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	64.96084594726562
"i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, "_i_ can
hardly be just to him."	66.36573791503906
conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long."	48.106849670410156
our situation
with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	23.40213966369629
mrs hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	45.29459762573242
but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.	38.36704635620117
he confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	57.51127243041992
did you see it?"	62.96152114868164
but in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair.	73.38350677490234
elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	63.71119689941406
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn-house.	42.839027404785156
she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	57.548500061035156
"i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	42.35331726074219
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	72.95377349853516
"she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	88.2955322265625
his coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.	57.4359016418457
if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it."	57.52142333984375
"the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	57.67538833618164
i expected
you to stay two months.	23.16273307800293
then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	46.613983154296875
"and what is your success?"	66.14266204833984
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs
bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	56.921043395996094
"very much."	27.259485244750977
there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	42.11333084106445
he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	16.68379020690918
she was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	37.294158935546875
"can you come to-morrow?"	47.39678192138672
if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	80.21758270263672
lord!	38.96706008911133
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton.	37.86087417602539
"how can you be smiling so,
lizzy?"	81.18116760253906
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	79.89207458496094
sir, i do indeed.	54.954734802246094
my aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing."	64.94387817382812
of having another daughter married to mr collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	57.91233444213867
we have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	66.46166229248047
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	76.92949676513672
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	49.293846130371094
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	72.87223815917969
he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there.	43.39946365356445
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley's continued
absence.	69.77218627929688
"did charlotte dine with you?"	63.52442169189453
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	45.5493278503418
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.	60.83549499511719
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	52.54425811767578
the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	68.55555725097656
there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."	58.82149124145508
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see mr jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield
because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards mr collins by jane's introduction of him.	72.9686279296875
but mr gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	69.67041778564453
elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	58.73757553100586
one ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!	64.3196792602539
but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	49.41215515136719
my dear hill, have you
heard the good news?	86.6524658203125
"but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king?	43.815250396728516
sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	68.00314331054688
well, my comfort is, i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."	54.05361557006836
the
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.	82.02458953857422
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"	326.26025390625
lydia's being settled in the
north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	39.26557540893555
her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	63.67623519897461
--she could have added, "a young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
manner!"	64.8016128540039
i quite forgot!	64.96509552001953
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton.	42.45652389526367
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	48.10614776611328
as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	47.85867691040039
mr darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	69.1700210571289
"never, sir."	59.77517318725586
the party did not supply much conversation.	73.33480834960938
you have delighted us long enough.	49.228389739990234
and gravely glancing
at mr darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i
shall keep mine to swell my song."	60.43922424316406
"you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	46.96891403198242
their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	83.03992462158203
"yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it?"	29.26105499267578
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	73.80496215820312
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.	82.94696807861328
its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	73.16802215576172
thank god!	59.56187438964844
"oh!	88.69083404541016

   information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.	72.45807647705078
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.	51.77587127685547
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation
and you!	77.99235534667969
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	77.35360717773438
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	53.59237289428711
elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord,
how tired i am!"	49.1780891418457
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of mr darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	64.82228088378906
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from mrs gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	40.253684997558594
whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.	51.92700958251953
"certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can
dance."	60.60198974609375
"no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	68.6998062133789
"if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	71.42532348632812
she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	55.93596649169922
she talked to elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	60.14127731323242
upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.	27.16087532043457
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	52.287601470947266
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as mr gardiner could do.	75.49015808105469
perhaps i am not doing her justice.	56.858863830566406
mr wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return.	67.98223114013672
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	77.14652252197266
the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	91.62052154541016
they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	55.85371398925781
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	46.265201568603516
i am so
pleased--so happy.	38.793277740478516
though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	71.02344512939453
"sir, you quite misunderstand me," said mrs bennet, alarmed.	16.020483016967773
if you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	26.65277862548828
she practises very constantly."	60.95230484008789
cried
jane.	57.23196029663086
"oh!"	73.80496215820312
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.	60.97963333129883
your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	43.7762451171875
"oh!	78.14874267578125
and with a bow to mr darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many
stared.--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	49.299354553222656
said she.	59.68437576293945
she dreaded seeing wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	48.85932540893555
i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."	71.60472106933594
the
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	57.818267822265625
there, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	90.13477325439453
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!	64.54349517822266
allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza, glancing
at her sister and bingley, shall take place.	65.93347930908203
his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	62.911705017089844
they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	74.17538452148438
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs
collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	86.12445068359375
as to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	36.96815872192383
elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	77.8565444946289
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	56.36809539794922
"who do you mean, my dear?	92.29473876953125
he was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	46.83634948730469
"your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.	55.34025955200195
"did not you?	69.96798706054688
"i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception.	49.87409973144531
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.	52.55328369140625
we can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	68.56631469726562
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	80.06461334228516
"i do not know when i have been more shocked," said she.	62.0290641784668
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married.	25.7697811126709
"merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.	51.16701126098633
she opened the
door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"oh, my dear eliza!	56.88783264160156
we have heard nothing from town."	62.21876907348633
i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."	83.41698455810547
after an affectionate
parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to mr and mrs gardiner, though unknown.	63.634620666503906
i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     william collins."	59.6663932800293
but it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	62.218265533447266
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here?	45.22946548461914
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as
to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.	62.04084014892578
by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	53.01945877075195
his
friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
ten days time.	67.24855041503906
who could have done less for her?	76.24049377441406
lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	66.44039154052734
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.	51.2790412902832
she is almost three and twenty!	93.55294036865234
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	50.87831115722656
added elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."	128.59979248046875
send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly.	38.61896514892578
she saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."	116.5321044921875
"indeed i had.	65.27367401123047
i can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_i_ have seen nothing of it."	53.480709075927734
"good gracious!	42.73499298095703
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	63.0487060546875
mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	64.68571472167969
every body said how well
she looked; and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	67.83492279052734
after a short silence, the lady first spoke.	55.741943359375
mrs gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.	48.05656814575195
but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	62.70720672607422
that had
his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as mr bingley, was incomprehensible.	43.77582931518555
"i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	69.45680236816406
mr darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	65.87602996826172
"you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."	65.83448791503906
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	67.13721466064453
they were in ----
     street.	71.7995376586914
he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	53.19415283203125
no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	72.15239715576172
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	83.62779235839844
after discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	113.79134368896484
she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	59.050498962402344
"not as you represent it.	57.866817474365234
but, really, i know not what to say.	51.54936599731445
you know i always
speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	73.80496215820312
nonsense, how can you talk so!	12.67082691192627
when she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr
darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining mr bingley for his sister.	42.05177688598633
"oh!	91.27835083007812
gardiner."	85.9393539428711
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.	91.71988677978516
i came to you without a
doubt of my reception.	42.30930709838867
she had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	49.46099090576172
"your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	64.9304428100586
"my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else!	46.13505935668945
he added, that mr
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and
promised to write again very soon.	71.71109771728516
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	84.14747619628906
if i was to go through the world, i could not
meet with a better.	54.00178146362305
jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.	79.37013244628906
this must be the grossest falsehood!"	92.4684829711914
well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	44.97602081298828
"and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."	72.9285888671875
"what would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?"	62.58213806152344
"in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	78.38629150390625
'lady
catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'	38.41581344604492
"yes; to the last.	42.10237121582031
but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.	67.09673309326172
observed mrs bennet.	59.148651123046875
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more."	73.5361557006836
the discussion of mr collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	53.72024154663086
he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.	60.21421432495117
elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.	55.83584976196289
your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.	79.92877197265625
i am sick of them all.	84.68327331542969
i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	71.0914077758789
"you appear to me, mr darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.	61.61200714111328
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	48.41584014892578
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when mr hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	60.865699768066406
if your
feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.	43.027042388916016
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	48.29182815551758
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	65.41486358642578
he made no answer.	56.64494705200195
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in paragraph 1.f.3.	82.32965087890625
in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	61.05268478393555
but i am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--they were excessively sorry to go!	37.911773681640625
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.	63.010929107666016
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	64.65194702148438
"good heavens!"	53.536380767822266
but
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	39.93627166748047
at first there
seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	45.770870208740234
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be very tolerable.	94.2366943359375
jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	45.89768981933594
miss darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	60.52836990356445
i came to try you.	66.59642791748047
"if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	37.227760314941406
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	39.47950744628906
at length the parsonage was discernible.	10.778395652770996
"except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate."	79.85460662841797
let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	95.08202362060547
yes.	47.435691833496094
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	47.61286163330078
but does not jane
correspond with the sister?	201.53489685058594
mr darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding.	59.36494827270508
from that moment i
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then
     perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had
     ever witnessed in him.	49.607181549072266
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?	189.77545166015625
we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	120.51213836669922
they were of a respectable family in
the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	77.25540924072266
the express was sent off directly.	162.61708068847656
but enough of this.	107.89591979980469
but, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	47.91493225097656
and is it really true?	35.23878860473633
their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	76.34968566894531
this, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
were not decidedly better.	62.760154724121094
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.	34.00227737426758
to be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he
_did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
about mr robinson."	43.33512878417969
the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way, that would induce you to accept me."	78.2777099609375
"and what arts did he use to separate them?"	56.406517028808594
i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."	62.8109016418457
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	48.8591423034668
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	35.58976364135742
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	65.996826171875
to persuade him against
     returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.	41.042991638183594
it would have suited
me in every respect."	67.35528564453125
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	56.947296142578125
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	67.06278991699219
their manners are not equal to his."	34.559974670410156
in
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	44.95132064819336
he
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	47.627098083496094
and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in
debt; but i hope this may be false."	45.19034957885742
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	89.20360565185547
"you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth.	57.18716812133789
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	78.4293212890625
but do not be cast down.	78.25240325927734
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	62.59296798706055
i have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	54.435302734375
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.	49.096832275390625
it is a pity they are not handsome!	49.1956901550293
they can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."	52.777408599853516
"elizabeth, you are not serious now."	282.053955078125
i thought
we never should have got into the coach.	31.45110321044922
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	76.50726318359375
"and quite alone?	66.83390045166016
shall you like to have such a brother?"	59.69009780883789
may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"	57.67222595214844
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	59.79698181152344
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	67.99374389648438
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."	61.65435791015625
while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at st. james's.	61.65153121948242
elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.	60.27638626098633
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
mrs bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	54.028411865234375
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	61.60051727294922
"there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	54.39451217651367
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	36.999393463134766
"yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	12.67082691192627
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	60.475494384765625
mrs bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	64.7153091430664
gardiner."	42.00624084472656
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.	36.832733154296875
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	82.62162017822266
she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet.	57.079742431640625
if i had ever learnt, i
should have been a great proficient.	74.16728210449219
i am sincerely grieved for him and
     mrs f. but no one can throw any blame on them.	66.00796508789062
"not so much as i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his
time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months."	34.62590026855469
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	29.401123046875
"nor i, i am sure," said miss bingley.	64.17865753173828
i should infinitely prefer a book."	53.554718017578125
"such as vanity and pride."	59.277061462402344
"compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	51.90330123901367
my dear mr bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	42.77708053588867
"but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.	55.15406036376953
"i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	65.3852310180664
i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."	52.11037826538086
she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.	50.50288391113281
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.	65.48976135253906
"i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	51.43416213989258
besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."	98.29728698730469
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	61.838253021240234
"something very much to the purpose of course.	45.707969665527344
who would
have thought it!	84.26531982421875
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	70.5234146118164
mr bingley and jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.	35.6024055480957
"i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	67.19155883789062
- you provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.	155.04531860351562
darcy said
nothing at all.	42.34038162231445
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.	36.68674850463867
"of whom does jane ever think ill?	66.32787322998047
you will hardly bear to be
long outdone by jane.	44.145774841308594
what will become of me.	73.56979370117188
his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."	32.24601364135742
"it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth.	80.90821075439453
elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	49.75006103515625
to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh?	59.17999267578125
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."	66.93449401855469
1.f.2.	59.75297927856445
a most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.	84.95339965820312
the
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness!	35.846099853515625
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence; mr darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	66.2864761352539
mrs gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	91.60423278808594
but it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."	129.60879516601562
"indeed you are mistaken.	155.53343200683594
what made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	75.91781616210938
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	56.37984085083008
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.	54.995994567871094
at length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	81.72760772705078
their reception from mr bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	82.89769744873047
every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	59.541114807128906
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
bingley.	55.260494232177734
i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	86.90354919433594
mr
hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	40.488372802734375
could there be
finer symptoms?	60.13407897949219
she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.	42.17768096923828
"not one."	69.6183853149414
my excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant.	66.8887710571289
"yes," thought elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.	66.80204010009766
rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	47.81055450439453
when you told mrs
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	61.90620422363281
"that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	67.85774230957031
at such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	66.26353454589844
what has she to do with it?	37.57500076293945
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."	74.47417449951172
he had been some time with mr gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning.	59.858863830566406
do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."	58.98467254638672
in another minute mr bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	37.60707092285156
he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	60.890777587890625
"would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	26.65277862548828
console lady catherine as well as
     you can.	77.57171630859375
can copy and distribute it in the united states without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.	75.96630096435547
"oh!"	46.16572570800781
that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."	35.1721076965332
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	50.721981048583984
his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	56.869606018066406
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
i assure you.	68.65670776367188
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	62.14120864868164
"you used us abominably ill," answered mrs hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."	49.196144104003906
"on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession
to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.	59.240020751953125
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	119.5749282836914
"would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	62.4495735168457
elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	57.31380844116211
what hours of transport we shall spend!	60.112518310546875
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.	58.89269256591797
there was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	56.582584381103516
"but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"	47.57421112060547
without a governess you must
have been neglected."	76.99011993408203
elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	64.95520782470703
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you
say that he was at rosings?"	34.46674728393555
they all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.	69.57630157470703
elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	51.89496994018555
the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	74.7255630493164
and when i returned home, the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	64.39240264892578
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
discourage him."	64.17281341552734
how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you."	131.47860717773438
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming.	58.68634033203125
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	80.93665313720703
it is of no consequence.	47.82953643798828
i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	62.663658142089844
and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"the men shan't come and part us, i am determined.	50.250240325927734
"eliza bennet," said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i dare say, it
succeeds.	72.14193725585938
"most willingly."	58.488075256347656
"it keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express."	52.891300201416016
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings.	69.90019226074219
when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	62.22007369995117
"_her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	53.59107971191406
i am glad he dines here on tuesday.	74.44893646240234
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	63.23308563232422
he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	47.507789611816406
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	8.788492202758789
first of all, he asked miss lucas.	48.186248779296875
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
ill at netherfield?"	85.46519470214844
1.f.3.	37.78279495239258
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you
will be satisfied with what i have done.	48.57344055175781
i know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.	58.67576599121094
good gracious!	35.08649444580078
"no; but it must be done soon."	32.88589859008789
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	69.8339614868164
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist mr wickham with money."	22.688518524169922
"a little."	68.74162292480469
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	43.15477752685547
yet he is _such_ a man!"	53.672874450683594
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and mr collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs philips.--the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.	43.99776840209961
--said jane faintly smiling,--"you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could
not hesitate."	68.13823699951172
but it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."	27.94816017150879
i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	46.661773681640625
she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	82.4906005859375
her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."	25.51744270324707
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?"	65.13938903808594
kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.	90.41384887695312
oh, lydia!"	71.7298355102539
you must learn some
of my philosophy.	43.75532531738281
the dejection was almost
universal.	73.0050277709961
she has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne's.	43.20326614379883
on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	40.54548263549805
he walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; charlotte tried to console her.	43.71601486206055
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	65.02555847167969
"write to me very often, my dear."	51.32652282714844
our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia's character.	39.549232482910156
we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	37.10142135620117
i dare say i shall
soon see them here."	123.79657745361328
it was
unpardonable.	68.51268005371094
you never see a fault in any body.	51.11944580078125
"oh, yes!--if one could but go to brighton!	65.81474304199219
it is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	83.76899719238281
"but upon my honour i do _not_.	51.35482406616211
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	65.64739990234375
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	61.81178665161133
you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	81.28458404541016
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	57.90001678466797
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	38.70059585571289
to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	76.93968963623047
mr bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	47.79472351074219
said she, as she looked in
her face.	45.025028228759766
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	62.839988708496094
his own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, mr wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited.	55.616756439208984
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to darcy,

"miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master.	43.169925689697266

works.	41.74320983886719
the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	104.10623931884766
said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam.	76.15667724609375
you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at pemberley with you."	36.7003059387207
hang kitty!	31.49408721923828
they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	81.47586059570312
"at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said mr bennet, as he folded up the letter.	77.27828979492188
miss bennet still looked all amazement.	69.95320892333984
elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention!	59.67009353637695
it was as
follows:

     "my dear sir,

     "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from hertfordshire.	74.84699249267578
mr collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	46.57386016845703
for, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	101.42842102050781
he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.	37.64122772216797
"but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."	87.23111724853516
"oh, well!	76.03287506103516
"now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to
table.	138.76060485839844
oh,
lord!	58.57085418701172
mr wickham began the subject himself.	69.35143280029297
"it must not be thought of.	67.38385009765625
till i was in kent, and saw
so much both of mr darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth myself.	50.44534683227539
why should they try to influence him?	58.61653137207031
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	38.3335075378418
bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	62.57422637939453
she is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
i will _make_ her know it."	41.50261306762695
elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	70.56932830810547
"i should be sorry indeed, if it were.	54.082271575927734
where is your sash my dear?"	59.08153533935547
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.	125.05128479003906
the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	43.74403762817383
elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	71.7422866821289
"and i certainly _never_ shall give it.	58.64077377319336
"then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
mr bingley to _her_."	46.66284942626953
how i wanted you!"	57.79332733154297
it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	49.35857391357422
thus, we do not necessarily
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	50.88092803955078
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	56.1580810546875
mrs hurst
thought the same, and added,

"she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	52.44205856323242
my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"	82.2520751953125
louisa and i were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."	62.26459503173828
it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr collins joining
in, observed,

"yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
be delighted with her.	59.74041748046875
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.	37.50223159790039
"i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want."	43.31476974487305
when they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be
soon married to mr bingley.--it was an animating subject, and mrs
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	53.654850006103516
she
looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	72.18749237060547
"i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton."	44.9720344543457
"very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.	61.481319427490234
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	62.23933410644531
it
was all pride and insolence.	65.66677856445312
"perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	52.3580322265625
as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	62.49026107788086
cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."	65.87276458740234
she
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	64.84358978271484
"of mr collins and lizzy.	65.30113983154297
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."	50.26571273803711
"i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	58.200103759765625
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.	48.88417053222656
_that_ is all to be forgot.	60.7637939453125
they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	60.29104232788086
it is just as he chooses.	27.409160614013672
soon after
     you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of london they were.	71.65571594238281
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	55.91839599609375
i write rather slowly."	47.425140380859375
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.	52.326480865478516
cried elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--how could
his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress?"	70.39563751220703
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	54.74698257446289
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	48.43985366821289
the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	84.33281707763672
they were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.	55.880645751953125
i will not tell you what it is.	166.00527954101562
darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	65.34527587890625
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to
satisfy.	51.32362747192383
"and my mother--how is she?	70.14129638671875
but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	52.09444046020508
the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	74.44474029541016
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."	78.85388946533203
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	65.32655334472656
no,
no--i feel he may defy us there.	66.06086730957031
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	67.63123321533203
i shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	48.74746322631836
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	22.128684997558594
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	10.309560775756836
"kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully.	42.92955780029297
1.e.7.	69.66304779052734
oh!	55.82419204711914
what could your ladyship propose by it?"	46.87327194213867
what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?	67.29493713378906
"what, none of you?"	56.01048278808594
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!	50.982566833496094
it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way.	66.09962463378906
"yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	39.429630279541016
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	114.75536346435547
i cannot find
out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	51.006591796875
"not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."	56.35892868041992
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth!	72.97924041748047
you have liked many a
stupider person."	68.96819305419922
"and this is always the way with him," she added.--"whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	50.30552673339844
to caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit.	58.796531677246094
"your's, &c."

this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	16.766183853149414
"i should like it beyond any thing!"	66.22966766357422
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	73.36202239990234
then pray speak aloud.	69.01227569580078
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	47.096435546875
jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	67.38294219970703
"lizzy, you must not do so.	98.10216522216797
i am not at all afraid of her dying.	63.6971321105957
"i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr bennet.	82.96527862548828
i have by no means done.	62.76374435424805
her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"there are very few people of whom so much can be said.	51.02052688598633
"you quite mistook mr darcy.	42.8120231628418
"undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	64.21300506591797
"it must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."	61.76996994018555
there was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	44.208003997802734
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	70.99564361572266
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	79.7771987915039
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	61.275306701660156
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	45.88423156738281
there was one part
especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the
power of reading again.	55.69902801513672
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	23.84668731689453
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	59.88527297973633
but the
clothes, the wedding clothes!	69.46581268310547
it was lady catherine de bourgh.	54.43702697753906
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	79.77018737792969
in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."	46.66151809692383
it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.	56.405338287353516
she has known him only a fortnight.	46.044578552246094
at any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."	73.3124008178711
but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the
trouble of practising.	81.08340454101562
"lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."	46.891990661621094
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	21.591442108154297
there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."	57.356204986572266
but mr gardiner
     could not be seen, and mr darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning.	79.46654510498047
mr
darcy may hug himself."	94.16136932373047
she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be mr darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	36.0589485168457
but she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	60.154014587402344
she is all affability and condescension, and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	57.697837829589844
i want to be told whether i
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham's character."	47.64566421508789
between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	56.56348419189453
*       *       *       *       *

the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs bennet's curiosity; and
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	45.250465393066406
i ought not to have said a word about it.	57.75189208984375
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins.	62.04441452026367
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
pemberley.	61.40591049194336
little more than half a day's
journey.	55.02361297607422
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	58.043235778808594
he was received by mrs
bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	42.4644660949707
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss
bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	57.84115982055664
pray, how _violent was_ mr bingley's
love?"	72.42656707763672
"if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside," cried bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."	68.97190856933594
"that is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	73.71421813964844
"perhaps that is not possible for any one.	69.46302795410156
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
meet mr darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--yet it did, and even a third.	118.56510162353516
you will find her manners beyond any
thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	55.25061798095703
mr gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	109.46979522705078
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr darcy!"	43.975223541259766
you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	76.65460968017578
it was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	46.96843719482422
i speak nothing but the truth.	56.31006622314453
and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.	55.88128662109375
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	79.6514892578125
and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."	106.28886413574219
again she read on.	58.17940139770508
but i have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."	111.36705017089844
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	53.49665069580078
it is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."	79.93643951416016
next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	46.64619064331055
you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."	73.80496215820312
you were
not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.	73.0829086303711
do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."	75.83203125
"oh!	67.21562957763672
"how despicably have i acted!"	64.06451416015625
mr bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	68.82026672363281
allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	58.95298385620117
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	72.00395965576172
"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."	61.89215087890625
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	58.60826110839844
"are they indeed?"	58.12272644042969
on opening the door, she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	48.395259857177734
she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	34.7220344543457
said he,
with a look of doubt.	63.4886589050293
bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
principal object.	105.52721405029297
"i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."	46.321311950683594
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth; but at last on mrs bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"oh!	57.47689437866211
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	60.635921478271484
_my_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."	60.880733489990234
mrs
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but mr collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with mr bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.	51.633968353271484
"is he married or single?"	55.539451599121094
yes, miss
bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	37.70092010498047
he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton.	38.944026947021484
elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	75.59872436523438
"i am talking of possibilities, charles."	77.695556640625
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	60.307289123535156
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	43.2763786315918
mrs bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	16.88040542602539
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	70.5208511352539
i believe i have now told you every thing.	40.76774597167969
mrs bennet could hardly
contain herself.	28.087055206298828
she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.	42.286434173583984
you know not what you are
about."	77.04550170898438
"yes, very handsome."	40.930206298828125
i will have no reserves from _you_."	57.247982025146484
it was some consolation to
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.	39.64570617675781
i am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but i hardly know what i have written."	42.066505432128906
his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	44.66337585449219
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them.	66.86137390136719
there is
one point, on which i want your advice.	63.40325164794922
his circumstances, he
     assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad.	53.629295349121094
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	55.753665924072266
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.	127.18043518066406
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time.	50.68971633911133
jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	50.46694564819336
and so did mrs
forster.	47.779911041259766
"they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."	69.04841613769531
thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!"	67.45901489257812
elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal."	72.30548858642578
"you judge very properly," said mr bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	16.20591163635254
you must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	73.80496215820312
"and do you impute it to either of those?"	50.803871154785156
cried lydia.	45.2786750793457
"oh!	59.99287796020508
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	69.03551483154297
"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them."	47.21242904663086
"you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short
silence.	82.15169525146484
we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.	68.52708435058594
it was over at last however.	41.43478012084961
mr wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family.	67.83149719238281
they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	74.84856414794922
if he _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never
     disgrace him.	49.26057052612305
and tell my dear
lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	48.483028411865234
such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	46.07261276245117
in that case he would return no more.	52.1309700012207
my feelings will not be
repressed.	44.864295959472656
remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."	102.58824920654297
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael
hart, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark.	45.49704360961914
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	36.85433578491211
your tempers are by no means unlike.	68.0615005493164
and in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	39.976844787597656
"you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."	87.22130584716797
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of mr darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	42.394405364990234
"design!	47.289302825927734
her father lifted up his eyes.	85.38330841064453
she was ashamed to think how
much.	81.09434509277344
for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr
darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."	38.38142395019531
and
what do you think she said besides?	69.02758026123047
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	68.13216400146484
i must beg to return to
the house."	82.54529571533203
as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	55.146697998046875
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	29.584331512451172
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield.	99.17350769042969
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

lydia declared herself satisfied.	53.49737548828125
thought elizabeth.	47.05805206298828
his
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	40.4792366027832
she was very
equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	73.80496215820312
his character was decided.	52.130149841308594
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	37.40104675292969
"oh!	48.81098556518555
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	113.6914291381836
"i do not recollect that we did."	41.97673797607422
elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.	50.08308792114258
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	67.28329467773438
on miss lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must."	48.55573654174805
"a great deal of good management, depend upon it.	66.98790740966797
but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.	54.20759201049805
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	55.051326751708984
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.	10.309560775756836
we have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
     approve.	60.321842193603516
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will
     immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.	48.35603713989258
oh!	84.98184204101562
to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	84.33201599121094
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success.	55.621482849121094
were it for nothing but his love of you, i
must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me.	80.06133270263672
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	71.42916870117188
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"	42.61345672607422
"what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?"	63.23139572143555
but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	57.29315185546875
she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."	70.1738510131836
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	82.41661071777344
"i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	105.72506713867188
it would have been strange if they had.	32.48748016357422
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	58.70393753051758
to all the
objections i have already urged, i have still another to add.	70.23175811767578
"and what did she say?"	38.965782165527344
"i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.	61.948726654052734
do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	42.728851318359375
"how can you talk so?"	46.88374328613281
"lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	65.38809967041016
certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."	79.08253479003906
"the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	106.16927337646484
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	51.78246307373047
"there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	51.190773010253906
i
always had a value for him.	53.357540130615234
my father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	54.96759796142578
i am quite well.	74.55248260498047
i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	54.54468536376953
--my mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right
     honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the church of england.	64.14481353759766
no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	45.73006820678711
they would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.	79.1380615234375
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	46.95079040527344
yours ever,

     "caroline bingley."	71.17176818847656
his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	30.594194412231445
something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	51.517887115478516
she could think only of her letter.	51.2798957824707
who attended to you?	48.01619338989258
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs
philips's manners and politeness.	49.75006103515625
i
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	49.305870056152344
this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham's being among them.	60.7081298828125
1.e.3.	91.85087585449219
jane looked at her doubtingly.	71.41082000732422
at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	69.57546997070312
nor was darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	53.07677459716797
"her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament.	64.7229232788086
my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!	69.1119613647461
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	38.7927131652832
he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	70.39413452148438
and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless.	91.78170013427734
"yes, i have had a letter from him by express."	85.84970092773438
"to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham;
or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.	27.57377052307129
i roused, and
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_.	59.23508071899414
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	71.18479919433594
"yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it."	57.42612838745117
those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as mrs forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	36.31269454956055
when first mr bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	52.69313430786133
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	53.7683219909668
its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	82.69931030273438
and
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information.	40.3349609375
"none at all.	50.971435546875
the old lady is mrs jenkinson, who lives with them.	65.55322265625
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.	68.56710052490234
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.	75.29527282714844
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	56.2354736328125
certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	93.78916931152344
"you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs nicholls was in
meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	31.95139503479004
i do not think it
is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.	39.2581901550293
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?	76.40802764892578
"we never had any governess."	83.2763442993164
she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	58.027103424072266
"oh, yes!--of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt.	45.0470085144043
"but you--how are you?"	97.7354507446289
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, i am sure.	74.72389221191406
but he is a
liberal master, i suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."	57.76222229003906
these parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	65.79625701904297
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	57.311370849609375
where shall you change
horses?--oh!	72.87539672851562
"some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	73.56880950927734
"well, then--supposing them to be in london.	50.981353759765625
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley!	39.672142028808594
"implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	42.557167053222656
"your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."	124.19225311279297
"why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned.	100.2875747680664
but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--here you are in your own family."	67.48712921142578
"ah!	38.92815017700195
a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	36.58855438232422
they were to be off as soon as possible.	71.9927978515625
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	49.09039306640625
if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	45.471256256103516
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this
discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	65.05094909667969
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."	73.27122497558594
she tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	62.581356048583984
very little was said by either; kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	83.95793914794922
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	92.2481460571289
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	65.47731018066406
thank heaven!	97.20519256591797
but
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	37.34070587158203
he has the
     promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the north.	74.99346160888672
he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	56.1551628112793
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy?"	36.35743713378906
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	56.117149353027344
stop me whilst you can."	48.11981964111328
"and can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"	47.62123489379883
there was no help
for it however.	80.65145111083984
can i speak plainer?	77.12846374511719
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for
elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	41.776424407958984
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?	134.1292266845703
the
adieu is charity itself.	64.92499542236328
indeed he has no improper pride.	67.28450775146484
how was that possible?	43.82133483886719
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	51.66377258300781
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch-street by noon.	62.46690368652344
"it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."	44.82581329345703
i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.	74.56681823730469
he is perfectly amiable.	59.50986099243164
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	61.47762680053711
cried elizabeth when she had
finished it.	96.2655029296875
that he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!	60.12404251098633
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	43.79133224487305
"how strange this is!	73.04207611083984
within doors there
was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	43.73793029785156
i can hardly write for
     laughing.	63.74148941040039
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.	46.44346618652344
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	52.196983337402344
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--though lydia had
never been a favourite with them, mr and mrs gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	62.05681610107422
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr darcy--that mr darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week.	65.176513671875
"you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by
all means to refuse him."	69.50743103027344
they solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	84.49853515625
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	37.62540817260742
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	64.1258544921875
and so, darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission!	37.101070404052734
it was then disclosed in the following
manner.	39.03561782836914
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for
himself."	49.80170822143555
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."	102.81568908691406
there
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	60.043277740478516
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for mr collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.	53.43482208251953
the children have been wanting me this half hour.	61.26347732543945
"no, my dear; i think not.	49.53626251220703
i was in the middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun."	60.12662124633789
"my dear, dear lydia!"	52.051025390625
"it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	68.69269561767578
she was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."	84.1645736694336
mrs reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.	92.83100128173828
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	62.0361328125
"but so we all do.	42.24162292480469
how is
such a man to be worked on?	65.94161987304688
the
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.	66.44017028808594
in future, i hope we shall be always of one
mind."	78.39511108398438
when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	60.9188346862793
i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.	46.70737075805664
i am so
grieved for him.	53.523284912109375
is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	67.50440979003906
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr
gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	50.47041702270508
wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to lydia's for him.	32.4883918762207
colonel fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	51.44957733154297
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family.	59.26877975463867
but papa is so
disagreeable."	71.61510467529297
it is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.	54.838714599609375
i
thank you for explaining it so fully.	66.52735137939453
all were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	40.78409957885742
"obstinate, headstrong girl!	75.42031860351562
elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of mr darcy.	94.53487396240234
"i am sick of mr bingley," cried his wife.	53.78297424316406
*       *       *       *       *




transcriber's note:

spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency
within the book.	57.7630729675293
but no
such recollection befriended her.	75.49148559570312
those were your words.	46.988460540771484
"miss bennet, do you know who i am?	48.048213958740234
there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	54.16584777832031
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	59.550228118896484
he placed himself by her.	69.36820220947266
if, indeed, it should be so!	220.0654754638672
i shall like it of all
things.	57.880943298339844
i
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his
     society in town.	47.9385986328125
and to see dear wickham too!	106.7236557006836
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	52.059715270996094
"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."	121.46687316894531
in three volumes.	57.23918914794922
to know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	85.3982162475586
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	61.00627517700195
we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	51.77921676635742
a house in town!	56.692420959472656
professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.	50.40357208251953
the garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.	36.27683639526367
i am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     hunsford.	48.06264877319336
it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to mr darcy.	58.73466110229492
good or bad?"	48.704200744628906
and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north.	47.12687683105469
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	69.80805969238281
"probably not;--but mr darcy can please where he chuses.	37.78401184082031
he
cannot afford it.	82.81472778320312
and then when we came away it was such fun!	42.03409194946289
i guessed as much."	74.10092163085938
nobody can tell what i
suffer!--but it is always so.	59.14019012451172
"_that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."	86.87156677246094
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	70.98816680908203
the horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	50.91807556152344
she cried.	110.9149398803711
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.	46.80635452270508
absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr collins.	51.484981536865234
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	70.51016235351562
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried elizabeth.	157.54940795898438
as all
conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.	70.58595275878906
she was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.	64.00516510009766
all was joy and
kindness.	53.3178825378418
he made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.	48.05103302001953
a scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	60.67976760864258
"i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	67.12991333007812
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	68.13082885742188
so, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."	40.00933074951172
you supposed more than
     really existed.	69.4574966430664
poor kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder.	74.68630981445312
upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."	57.02410888671875
by this time she is
actually with them!	70.30281829833984
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	57.12565612792969
miss bingley said something of his never
     returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.	79.86424255371094
"wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	77.19671630859375
you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	82.2135238647461
i was afraid they might
not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was
determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like
any thing."	31.32535743713379
"indeed i could not.	60.15082931518555
the idea of mr collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	40.09429931640625
"i never heard that it was."	69.62382507324219
"this account then is what he has received from mr darcy.	76.34538269042969
it is a nice long walk, and mr darcy has
never seen the view."	62.47920227050781
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	80.16030883789062
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
detained first by the civility of mr collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	44.66093826293945
it
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	57.49507141113281
why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	50.50910949707031
"is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"	93.3694076538086
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	57.54649353027344
he bore it however with admirable calmness.	46.09535598754883
and there was my
aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	83.97715759277344
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"you look conscious.	57.24885559082031
"exceedingly well.	61.056270599365234
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?	73.98120880126953
i told my sister philips so the other day.	99.66097259521484
your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
you.	68.98871612548828
it convinced her, that
accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister's being in town.	41.118221282958984
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	55.01668930053711
if i may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."	45.01016616821289
"this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced."	54.203182220458984
was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	91.5493392944336
on finding
mrs bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"	42.920040130615234
"i see your design, bingley," said his friend.--"you dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."	72.21566009521484
"then, who taught you?	80.37808990478516
though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	51.30084228515625
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!	66.65249633789062
when they
had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said,

"this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	61.37953567504883
he had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.	83.08487701416016
i
     take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not,
     but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible.	56.89849090576172
"_you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne
for fifty pounds!	102.02748107910156
"their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
i, nor any body, can ever forget.	43.500701904296875
secondly, that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness.	72.18605041503906
well, but now for
my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	50.24256896972656
and a
special licence.	32.30043029785156
calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.	88.99266815185547
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied darcy.	80.91083526611328
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	31.794404983520508
what is it about?	85.02432250976562
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	70.6915512084961
how can it affect them?"	62.106990814208984
"this is not to be borne.	57.10103225708008
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	53.15103530883789
mrs gardiner, who was several years younger than
mrs bennet and mrs philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces.	78.49198913574219
i rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.	59.23987579345703
you have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.	80.65106201171875
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	60.06664276123047
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	67.05352020263672
elizabeth immediately began playing again.	47.089744567871094
you know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	73.80496215820312
"i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield.	47.5073356628418
it may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	55.91081619262695
"oh!	73.80496215820312
she looked at jane, to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
talking to bingley.	55.06258773803711
it is of all subjects my delight.	43.339351654052734
"oh!	57.17945098876953
"he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."	39.05521011352539
we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	48.914180755615234
"my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me.	93.3446273803711
those who do not complain are never
pitied."	36.07591247558594
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	42.045501708984375
with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed.	52.53118133544922
"we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire."	42.62666320800781
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	44.6549072265625
there was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	101.808349609375
indeed, eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."	61.55967330932617
seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	51.005306243896484
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.	109.26546478271484
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	39.36455154418945
"that is as it happens.	71.4140853881836
"your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	62.425811767578125
you have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."	48.32506561279297
their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	74.88922119140625
"and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	73.70539093017578
mr darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to mrs collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	46.51584243774414
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	66.3855209350586
the
possibility of meeting mr darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	50.44388198852539
"lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	56.58121109008789
how is half such a sum to be
repaid?"	44.904415130615234
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling."	62.66179656982422
at present i will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	20.394941329956055
miss lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	38.97068786621094
his words
seemed to imply it.	60.532012939453125
make haste, make haste.	51.40862274169922
mrs bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	65.1474609375
had the late mr darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life.	48.657344818115234
"but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	29.374954223632812
"i should imagine not."	42.68724060058594
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	61.821510314941406
but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them.	46.19295120239258
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	31.970792770385742
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	51.41145324707031
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	53.51839828491211
now is your time.	61.89808654785156
"he must be an oddity, i think," said she.	48.10279846191406
two days after mr bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask."	91.79390716552734
i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."	66.04039764404297
i shall send for my
     clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up.	49.08045959472656
march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford.	74.06372833251953
accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.	97.37841796875
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	58.426692962646484
my dear mr bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?	68.85424041748047
but who was your mother?	85.34766387939453
mr collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and mr darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	51.963165283203125
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	65.83615112304688
how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	61.12699890136719
if you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	50.69646072387695
"we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--how much i shall have to tell!"	30.29846954345703
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs
gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	37.2758903503418
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	58.191917419433594
"all young ladies accomplished!	64.74015045166016
"i should never have said mrs collins
was settled _near_ her family."	47.226375579833984
mr
bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before."	56.76443099975586
mr darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"this walk is not wide enough for our party.	10.309560775756836
jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw mr darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	67.81526184082031
it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's
attractions.	73.39515686035156
oh!	52.80549240112305
let us hope for
better things.	66.65360260009766
"you begin to comprehend me, do you?"	42.98649215698242
they were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	81.25939178466797
after
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.	61.28459930419922
"i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."	60.720088958740234
"my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	88.1799545288086
since her
father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."	42.440250396728516
if there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	56.87431716918945
so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	93.48355102539062
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	40.681758880615234
they walked on, without knowing in what direction.	71.5068359375
he was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	63.56484603881836
i hope they will not meet at all.	54.23387145996094
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy."	74.85291290283203
she stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	55.65317916870117
"but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	66.2890625
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	33.0976448059082
"i know them a little.	26.65277862548828
it was first broken by mrs annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and mrs gardiner, with occasional help from
elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	47.51792907714844
promise me, therefore, to
come to hunsford."	57.264225006103516
"oh!"	73.97443389892578
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	48.681434631347656
and with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."	60.196502685546875
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	50.63256072998047
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	48.09868240356445
"well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
collinses live very comfortable, do they?	66.93551635742188
she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."	57.31744384765625
"but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.	56.25153350830078
their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	62.512020111083984
charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility.	73.80496215820312
but i make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	68.33326721191406
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you."	106.23223114013672
"oh!	60.96355438232422
"your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.	38.5864143371582
i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	66.24777221679688
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	34.561527252197266
it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."	41.266136169433594
but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
dare say, very agreeable.	57.918495178222656
it is useless to talk of it."	46.68286895751953
he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to elizabeth again, he walked away.	55.785526275634766
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	65.02242279052734
but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."	78.24774169921875
not that i am afraid
of _myself_, but i dread other people's remarks."	40.5505256652832
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with wickham!--imagine our surprise.	67.37754821777344
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"is not this nice?	68.95205688476562
"no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	51.02111053466797
"from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry."	64.56873321533203
if he fears me, why come hither?	32.81781005859375
mr jones says we must not think of moving her.	57.00766372680664
the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine's drawing-room.	54.199241638183594
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	27.024120330810547
he danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	54.924110412597656
"and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."	47.02778244018555
it will not do.	49.538516998291016
i enquired after their brother, of course.	54.7818717956543
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	47.324920654296875
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"	53.898033142089844
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, mr darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	62.03719711303711
"her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	71.99472045898438
but
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted.	63.277217864990234
to the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	42.3955192565918
through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	62.77170944213867
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.	43.8526611328125
if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	45.62077713012695
miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	50.16986846923828
mr collins was eloquent in her praise.	79.2127685546875
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	68.27278900146484
don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
     that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side.	48.777706146240234
i knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.	10.309560775756836
elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	43.25392532348633
as they drove to mr gardiner's
door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	50.96356201171875
oh!	27.806549072265625
cried mrs gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	58.87017059326172
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	59.493492126464844
you are safe from me."	50.47727966308594
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	65.59605407714844
unfeeling, selfish girl!	48.24176788330078
"both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	57.49644088745117
"i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."	72.42218780517578
he only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."	65.0682373046875
she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."	78.71549224853516
she
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	27.6575984954834
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known sir william's too long.	82.92794036865234
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	60.414737701416016
mr and mrs gardiner smiled.	46.84485626220703
"the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	67.60775756835938
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	56.646400451660156
let me never see either
one or the other again!"	49.303768157958984
it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	33.233619689941406
if i could but see _you_ as happy!	37.02165222167969
her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	62.96932601928711
charlotte is an
excellent manager, i dare say.	58.01002883911133
let me mend it for you.	62.21147155761719
he
drew a chair near her.	47.05181121826172
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	75.15283966064453
she had heard nothing of
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	60.15971755981445
he heard her attentively, and then said,

"lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."	69.68737030029297
you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing."	55.2640495300293
on this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	69.8768310546875
i could hardly keep my countenance.	45.57868194580078
her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh."	10.309560775756836
his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	42.67510223388672
if your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning.	48.17449188232422
oh!	61.24671173095703
exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good.	64.1978759765625
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	64.54660034179688
he spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.	75.07074737548828
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to
wickham.	63.501129150390625
jane was by no means better.	69.5230484008789
no officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.	44.46601486206055
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	48.461360931396484
i do think mrs long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."	51.38556671142578
"indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	40.5109748840332
_they_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	43.63758850097656
we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way.	54.44664764404297
i should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire."	72.47933197021484
"if he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "i shall give him up for
ever."	64.4865493774414
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	52.72355651855469
her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire.	50.48401641845703
her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	66.5139389038086
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.	42.679935455322266
for
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	46.23690414428711
he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	47.980525970458984
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,

"lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe.	58.26121520996094
you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	37.69450759887695
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	64.94470977783203
from the entrance hall, of which mr collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine,
her daughter, and mrs jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	48.47028350830078
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	72.7538070678711
"thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	61.45922088623047
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	51.1638298034668
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.	54.64573287963867
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.	54.526824951171875
when mrs bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	77.31307983398438
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	48.19102478027344
at least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."	81.63159942626953
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	65.5443115234375
pray do not talk of that odious man.	46.823341369628906
but with _me_, it is not so.	53.63290023803711
he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.	63.12580871582031
he looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at pemberley.	65.82968139648438
the former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	73.4146499633789
my temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."	70.0157470703125
but i will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	50.68972396850586
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield.	104.44840240478516
"his manners are very different from his cousin's."	45.08009719848633
upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	48.01296615600586
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	72.08881378173828
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	50.64680862426758
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	53.17612075805664
this was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and elizabeth found, that though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for.	65.87169647216797
she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	57.4891471862793
"my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope to make you love me.	61.72233581542969
it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	55.144493103027344
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	28.189563751220703
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	56.65031814575195
he had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."	69.76217651367188
cried elizabeth.	45.44855880737305
on saturday he came again.	76.50277709960938
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate.	60.12624740600586
"miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that i am not to be trifled with.	79.1236801147461
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	48.996089935302734
but amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following,
     as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly
     went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference.	60.69200897216797
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	63.6947021484375
she was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	59.334808349609375
mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	58.839332580566406
she read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	71.15079498291016
in
talking over their route the evening before, mrs gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.	45.24380874633789
he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him."	108.9798583984375
her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	59.50384521484375
in
truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings."	28.005996704101562
and for _this_ we are to be
thankful.	55.596580505371094
every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	80.27735137939453
you need not.	29.598167419433594
"it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	53.210758209228516
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	36.85146713256836
said he; "that is rather singular."	67.69982147216797
she was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	71.29578399658203
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do, when i
tell you all."	70.04129028320312
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	29.154027938842773
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	55.670806884765625
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	40.74919509887695
"indeed!"	56.871116638183594
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	37.50591278076172
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	47.36943054199219
it was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	39.35498809814453
but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	65.14031219482422
then turning to mr bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	21.454545974731445
i thought i should have broke my heart."	39.33427810668945
when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	48.59330368041992
it is too long ago.	37.71127700805664
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	93.86277770996094
"my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."	37.193790435791016
"yes, or i will never see her again."	42.89990997314453
her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	106.97769165039062
"i must ask whether you were surprised?"	60.221134185791016
mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and
mrs collins well."	57.26261520385742
but make a virtue of it
by all means.	67.63883972167969
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know, and read great
books, and make extracts."	71.84638977050781
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	27.05131721496582
why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	59.6391716003418
- you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing or by e-mail within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg-tm
     license.	70.39030456542969
it is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.	48.04777908325195
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	60.013282775878906
she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	54.99027633666992
elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	148.8740692138672
nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	37.559425354003906
what are men
to rocks and mountains?	50.422271728515625
"very, very much.	47.627620697021484
i am only ashamed of his asking so little."	50.01468276977539
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	48.63935852050781
jane was not happy.	75.15039825439453
let me advise you then, my dear sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.	40.71452713012695
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make _me_
happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."	47.67960739135742
"i am not now to learn," replied mr collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	60.842567443847656
he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."	49.17129135131836
"my dear jane!"	40.925968170166016
their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	63.728240966796875
not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	63.42620849609375
yet now i must believe you," cried
jane.	61.97014617919922
nothing could be more delightful!	50.492286682128906
"upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--pray, what is your age?"	64.61038208007812
"oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	56.00556945800781
"and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business."	58.36741256713867
having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	53.457008361816406
on this
subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left
hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'mr collins, you
must marry.	46.844791412353516
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of
short duration.	34.980525970458984
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs forster,
the delight of mrs bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
to be described.	70.7035903930664
it is from my cousin, mr collins, who, when i am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	68.53015899658203
"_you_ were mr bingley's first choice."	31.50584602355957
did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in kent?"	146.4425811767578
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin.	66.65919494628906
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	87.3507080078125
poor little lizzy!	74.17672729492188
the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
lydia's infamy somewhat better.	35.008766174316406
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	39.582889556884766
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when
he put his letter into her hand!	57.54487228393555
in a few minutes, mrs bennet half opened the door and called out,

"lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you."	60.871212005615234
not all that mrs bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley.	72.9867172241211
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	53.58830261230469
"i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	89.01231384277344
you may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night.	54.621273040771484
"i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am
gone."	42.38505554199219
this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	52.7037467956543
but my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards miss king.	49.80795669555664
"you are joking, lizzy.	107.47984313964844
i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the
country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	67.70437622070312
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent.	47.221378326416016
it adds even another motive.	55.925140380859375
pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	51.69850540161133
"i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always speak
what i think."	87.01364135742188
"i told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	58.401039123535156
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	83.2033462524414
"what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	51.58777618408203
with his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	64.28070068359375
"very true; and if i had my will, we should.	61.598907470703125
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	53.52421569824219
it seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	58.858970642089844
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies.	61.99301528930664
i know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have
     still something more to ask of the former.	24.5893611907959
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	32.2325439453125
i am glad
he is gone.	67.37896728515625
mr bingley followed his advice.	45.97919464111328
but i
will not repine.	68.08523559570312
she longed to see mrs philips, the lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to mrs hill and the two housemaids.	90.6324691772461
mr bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	75.74663543701172
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	44.98993682861328
so much the man of fashion!	43.73931121826172
my dear charlotte,--impossible!"	79.37437438964844
"good gracious!"	99.77733612060547
elizabeth made no answer.	49.85993957519531
such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!	62.8097038269043
interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	105.83087921142578
not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive.	46.871620178222656
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months!	45.82544708251953
"what think you of books?"	68.42475891113281
"but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."	44.653995513916016
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.	58.298091888427734
"very well.--that reply will do for the present.--perhaps by and bye i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--but _now_ we may be silent."	54.164337158203125
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	223.07369995117188
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	68.64234161376953
"well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	37.76759338378906
mr what's his name.	75.91734313964844
she knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.	45.277252197265625
i know we dine with four and twenty families."	58.161624908447266
she saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility
was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate
to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	41.2619743347168
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	37.02864074707031
no
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	47.03038024902344
colonel forster will, i dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	144.28897094726562
this matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."	43.30701446533203
mr wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.	63.22633361816406
"good heaven!	57.5245475769043
after sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth,

"i hope you are well, miss bennet.	64.07423400878906
her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	86.14128875732422
they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	68.52650451660156
when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	55.38822937011719
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.	42.478660583496094
it was to be such a secret!"	39.91585159301758
bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	49.692806243896484
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.	57.22118377685547
i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	43.882625579833984
while sir william was with them, mr collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	79.17078399658203
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	48.45494079589844
"his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.	52.92153549194336
i pity, though i
     cannot help blaming her.	39.71062088012695
that he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	43.58096694946289
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	56.30815887451172
i speak
feelingly.	62.56876754760742
"he
only told me, what i have now told you."	44.4079475402832
if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.	67.99295806884766
you shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	71.67823791503906
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about.	41.7073974609375
i will read it to you--

"when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	58.54920959472656
the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	63.28750991821289
"that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."	67.9203109741211
is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very
ill."

"no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	55.003177642822266
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	39.60926818847656
she had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr wickham
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows."	37.58256149291992
you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mother's permission for this address.	66.70671081542969
she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	81.29610443115234
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	42.27334976196289
"or in other words, you are determined to have him.	38.49453353881836
their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.	50.9329833984375
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and i know i appeared distressed.	51.61202621459961
you know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	52.59352493286133
yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."	56.13944625854492
jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	62.437007904052734
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	47.893367767333984
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?	54.28744125366211
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr philips's.	57.91965866088867
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment.	47.50876235961914
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.	51.728981018066406
to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of mr bingley's heart were entertained.	55.02222442626953
but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.	43.08238220214844
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham.	44.27436447143555
what are we to do!"	69.6031723022461
"what does mr darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?"	56.001617431640625
why any fear of detection?	74.59004211425781
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	35.172515869140625
you _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	58.52210998535156
he was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	53.60527420043945
"do you prefer reading to cards?"	59.56925582885742
then shewing
her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet.	26.840173721313477
as they passed through the hall,
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	56.50843811035156
"you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	57.40026092529297
you are lucky in
having such a master."	113.55955505371094
change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."	55.24479293823242
reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	34.546817779541016
_invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square._

_engraved for no.	54.4235954284668
mrs philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though mrs philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	91.43517303466797
"we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	50.15999984741211
"there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	37.614105224609375
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely."	35.905277252197266
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,"
said mrs bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, i shall have nothing to wish for."	70.03581237792969
mr gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was saturday.	60.17713165283203
mr wickham
had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	60.36684799194336
the sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	49.87874984741211
cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after mr and mrs gardiner.	50.19989776611328
not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	93.17709350585938
"an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	45.61551284790039
"you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."	44.0346794128418
to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	57.71698760986328
"i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."	51.76140594482422
however, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."	79.21541595458984
bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening mrs bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.	38.38100814819336
"your examination of mr darcy is over, i presume," said miss
bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	63.569149017333984
it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	52.06237030029297
he cannot know what mr
darcy is."	52.5577392578125
two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	73.80496215820312
he has given in all his debts; i hope
     at least he has not deceived us.	74.34768676757812
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	41.51252746582031
"oh!	45.05329132080078
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	62.05743408203125
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.	115.62452697753906
"take whatever you like, and get away."	35.2031135559082
"you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr darcy?"	52.3961296081543
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	46.343353271484375
i did not think mrs
gardiner was so little to be trusted."	50.950836181640625
"i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	53.32632827758789
she dared not
even mention that gentleman.	49.75006103515625
"we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	48.86419677734375
the vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr darcy could not have.	50.3740348815918
1.c.	188.13876342773438
mrs collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	135.6881561279297
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	55.12611389160156
i have not _that_ pain.	57.190059661865234
it is almost past belief.	62.20367431640625
you are so strange!	75.07353973388672
it was
the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	25.148881912231445
when this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	17.871164321899414
perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice.	69.34253692626953
it has been my own doing,
and i ought to feel it."	44.99464797973633
"nearly three weeks."	21.626008987426758
i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his
regimentals."	48.315975189208984
did you see him while you were at lambton?	27.95809555053711
i
did not expect such a compliment."	73.02734375
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	54.51099395751953
to kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected.	44.01231002807617
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	30.084959030151367
well, i was so frightened i did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	10.309560775756836
they had long wished to see him.	57.7006950378418
but it is so
strange!"	46.58389663696289
oh!	61.86084747314453
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	58.242130279541016
"i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	23.11764144897461
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr darcy.--_i_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."	79.58209228515625
heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	67.11531829833984
sir william did not say much.	54.22504425048828
he begged
pardon for having displeased her.	69.46813201904297
at that moment, she cared for no other.	34.207210540771484
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	36.41047668457031
i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.	50.47697448730469
i have suspected it some time, but
i am now convinced."	57.88671112060547
"i can easily believe it.	66.79952239990234
in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	88.7690200805664
she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	53.8164176940918
the effect was immediate.	39.62839126586914
"in what an amiable light does this place him!"	55.652652740478516
in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he
wants you in the library."	45.04328155517578
"well, lizzy," said mrs bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of jane's?	51.501319885253906
my sole dependence was on you; and
i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	51.136985778808594
she wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	44.627811431884766
elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	71.01175689697266
not a soul knew of it, but col. and mrs
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	57.11873245239258
"what do you mean, mr bennet, by talking in this way?	33.485496520996094
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
case?"	58.000885009765625
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.	68.80201721191406
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	53.46925735473633
"true," said mr bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."	47.35759735107422
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on.	78.01195526123047
it is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	41.95175552368164
georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	59.09827423095703
it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.	34.37690353393555
"and mary king is safe!"	57.528358459472656
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done.	62.71399688720703
a few weeks, he believed.	62.5617561340332
the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	57.763572692871094
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."	24.34313201904297
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.	63.06909942626953
at length darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."	62.899105072021484
no."	62.978214263916016
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."	59.33467102050781
she followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!	70.65080261230469
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.	62.02607727050781
i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	40.12331008911133
your's, &c."

mr darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what mr bennet sent to mr collins, in
reply to his last.	33.82256317138672
as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	57.02946472167969
they were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	40.130157470703125
we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."	88.03114318847656
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; mr bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
fixed for the following tuesday.	33.248748779296875
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy.	61.05982208251953
it is unaccountable!	58.36143112182617
she shall hear my opinion."	47.84978103637695
kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	53.6433219909668
she wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false!	58.2823600769043
charlotte did not stay much
longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	54.39196014404297
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to mr bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	66.74122619628906
but that is nothing to us.	51.737037658691406
"what do you think?	41.668357849121094
such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	10.309560775756836
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was
shocked.	52.0740852355957
you
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be.	81.81947326660156
oh!	81.04100036621094
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
about this report?	49.621273040771484
she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.	33.267295837402344
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.	53.18090057373047
"there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.	45.09758377075195
i do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy."	70.35560607910156
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's
visit.	72.83329010009766
mr bennet's expectations were fully answered.	44.1581916809082
her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	71.7409896850586
the carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	65.34122467041016
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town
next saturday."	63.17850875854492
his father, miss bennet, the late mr darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	51.20111846923828
the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, mr bingley?"	31.334556579589844
never mind miss
lizzy's hair."	50.60725402832031
it had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	62.51755905151367
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	44.35563278198242
"i am not one and twenty."	58.142799377441406
very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	61.734375
"i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	38.786659240722656
on the very day of my coming
     home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	38.83676528930664
"i am afraid, mr darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."	41.31591796875
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity.	55.908287048339844
catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to london.	75.22256469726562
my sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel
     fitzwilliam, and myself.	46.914608001708984
they
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	26.717304229736328
"i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel
millar's regiment went away.	142.4025421142578
"why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"	51.79246520996094
oh, no."	59.48191452026367
there's for you!	61.05321502685547
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	67.0427474975586
but now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage.	73.80496215820312
the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	64.89907836914062
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn.	45.51995086669922
"oh!	58.66560745239258
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	54.475135803222656
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	69.3999252319336
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.	44.83287811279297
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	46.24793243408203
not that _i_ think
charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."	52.0847053527832
she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	59.87479019165039
he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley's salutation.	73.1330337524414
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	61.002838134765625
the advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	45.2363166809082
and her neighbours at
lucas lodge, therefore, for through their communication with the
collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	50.628746032714844
it would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	57.840553283691406
"when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	64.77442169189453
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	47.74943542480469
my feelings in every respect
forbid it.	70.75630187988281
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	31.828168869018555
"yes, and i had heard it before.	58.33391189575195
would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	42.67371368408203
yes, yes.	48.628421783447266
jane now came up.	60.808834075927734
not these two or three years perhaps."	49.092979431152344
bingley met them with hopes
that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.	49.114219665527344
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	75.49419403076172
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia,
assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn.	54.25789260864258
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	35.4788703918457
"if i were as rich as mr darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his
sisters, "i should not care how proud i was.	51.90373992919922
_he_ was
     exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
     would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter
     last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain.	38.961029052734375
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	59.53912353515625
much as i abominate
writing, i would not give up mr collins's correspondence for any
consideration.	34.57419967651367
"_i_ never saw such a woman.	71.61248016357422
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	50.81698989868164
you must send john with
the young ladies, mrs collins.	96.38046264648438
they are
wanted in the farm, mr bennet, are not they?"	42.018009185791016
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	26.13035011291504
"and what is fifty miles of good road?	45.29429626464844
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?"	59.74568557739258
but i dare not
hope it.	59.99673843383789
"in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	47.135215759277344
when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	90.84776306152344
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	53.65807342529297
"your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	69.25360870361328
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.	63.67307662963867
her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	46.45615768432617
be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	43.72627258300781
mr
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	59.00220489501953
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to.	83.68272399902344
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	41.95291519165039
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i
     laugh.	48.55964660644531
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.	57.911094665527344
--

"my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	40.36052322387695
elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	55.2073974609375
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, mr darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."	60.2868766784668
darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.	46.837284088134766
two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	74.885009765625
family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	45.05030822753906
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	37.7614860534668
mr collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	32.82096481323242
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but mrs bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	47.755126953125
"can it be
possible that he will marry her?"	22.10423469543457
that lady i suppose is your mother."	53.37916946411133
but, lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	48.542911529541016
said elizabeth.	63.402191162109375
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.	51.636749267578125
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	78.2923812866211
"two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	48.87724304199219
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's."	45.965267181396484
ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	50.563629150390625
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."	49.06752014160156
"because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	235.13388061523438
"whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes.	56.61357116699219
had he done his duty in that
respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	59.10196304321289
'ah!	41.48263931274414
while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	43.952571868896484
my youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who i believe will soon become a part of the family."	52.618099212646484
"much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."	131.35818481445312
she was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.	64.15910339355469
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"	63.070030212402344
mamma would like to
go too of all things!	46.73573684692383
"oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
scotland."	37.76294708251953
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--mr collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	67.42122650146484
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	57.143768310546875
"which do you mean?"	32.67070007324219
it
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	63.02399826049805
"he is as fine a fellow," said mr bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever i saw.	45.27358627319336
that is the place to get
husbands.	59.642303466796875
mrs
reynolds could interest her on no other point.	38.81352996826172
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	41.776546478271484
it originated in
mrs gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	36.54161071777344
she directly replied,

"you need not be frightened.	46.46989822387695
"you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with cold civility,
"that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."	45.671966552734375
"let me be rightly understood.	49.40720748901367
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	33.535282135009766
with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	48.720218658447266
you know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	51.298946380615234
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance."	86.87156677246094
"yes, all of them, i think.	39.09673309326172
while
there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	62.78278350830078
she cried.	75.27843475341797
but don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.	47.84288787841797
haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week.	51.42646408081055
to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	82.90912628173828
by tea-time however the dose had been enough, and mr bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	55.53715133666992
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	51.232994079589844
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	45.25501251220703
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	85.27040100097656
they
are my old friends.	48.381656646728516
"it may do very well for the others," replied mr bingley; "but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty.	54.09864044189453
my avowed one, or what i avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made."	77.68750762939453
have you never
happened to see her there?"	65.47405242919922
his character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr
darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	52.53044509887695
mr wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.	48.022647857666016
a promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	83.29043579101562
she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	65.4201889038086
miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy.	49.66499328613281
i have a high respect for your nerves.	53.15491485595703
"with the officers!"	57.50006103515625
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving
home.	83.5141372680664
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	61.15454864501953
"he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	40.58641052246094
"i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage.	69.39913177490234
the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.	52.44159698486328
"i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him.	45.17346954345703
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	44.03206253051758
but pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	53.64521408081055
were it known to the rest
of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	19.69051170349121
but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.	45.39118194580078
her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	47.50239944458008
there is nothing else to be done.	53.65532302856445
in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	60.11099624633789
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh
looked that way.	53.718849182128906
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.	47.80793762207031
she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"is your sister at pemberley still?"	50.62876892089844
i am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	44.446407318115234
and his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	50.598167419433594
she respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	40.95344543457031
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	32.89203643798828
"when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and
when i am in town it is pretty much the same.	52.144046783447266
"i am all astonishment.	40.75428771972656
i longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	58.95447540283203
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	50.89490509033203
if i wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	35.52702331542969
i do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	104.07780456542969
"let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."	46.45568084716797
unless the elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	48.76235580444336
and then we were so merry all the way home!	45.156593322753906
*       *       *       *       *

in the evening, soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
mr darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	68.78794860839844
with a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at netherfield.	52.57509994506836
he still loves me, and we are
engaged."	51.565834045410156
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	52.98515319824219
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	49.31843566894531
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	50.40330505371094
it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	52.7525634765625
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at
present i have not room to do them justice."	48.18352508544922
he did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	48.06180953979492
"it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	40.568260192871094
charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley."	43.1511344909668
she had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	68.85424041748047
he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."	35.414363861083984
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	83.54061889648438
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	43.7762451171875
"you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan."	49.29164505004883
but i was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	47.96969223022461
said she.	38.41328811645508
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.	52.307125091552734
bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	50.061767578125
jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.	53.97452926635742
after sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london,
mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	48.109275817871094
"he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	40.812461853027344
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	50.47214126586914
there are few people
whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.	59.61494827270508
painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	33.891380310058594
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	58.17815399169922
and so
she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	63.308536529541016
i told mrs collins so before you came.	59.80742263793945
"nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth.	32.46132278442383
i have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	52.13728332519531
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day.	59.530635833740234
"i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	49.8175048828125
but on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	27.837177276611328
"my dear brother,

     "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction.	117.47761535644531
"you know nothing of the matter.	48.32731246948242
you must contrive to send
somebody.	38.883636474609375
"are you, indeed?	66.60185241699219
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	60.19288635253906
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	50.92692184448242
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world!	62.581153869628906
they were hopeless of remedy.	72.1226806640625
"when you have killed all your own birds, mr bingley," said her mother,
"i beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on mr
bennet's manor.	53.57356643676758
mr collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	43.44165802001953
i perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	25.01955795288086
"i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	69.24162292480469
but i will no longer importune my young cousin."	37.207847595214844
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	47.47111511230469
"will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"	43.709842681884766
mr darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	57.079307556152344
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.	71.4044189453125
but however he did not.	59.825477600097656
i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	46.365177154541016
to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	53.93147277832031
yet he knew to the contrary himself.	30.781831741333008
she could
think of nothing but of mr wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent.	49.80048751831055
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	56.24528503417969
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.	82.08429718017578
he must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.	42.66364669799805
with a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	48.32553482055664
and pray what sort of guardians do you make?	81.63825225830078
"i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	63.219703674316406
"i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	54.04225158691406
i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	66.24613189697266
though lydia's short
     letter to mrs f. gave them to understand that they were going to
     gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief
     that w. never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which
     was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from b. intending to trace their route.	46.309444427490234
regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and mrs younge was of course removed from
     her charge.	76.6942367553711
this room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	39.83470916748047
we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	32.911685943603516
his choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing.	49.464385986328125
her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	93.80249786376953
sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know
that mr collins wants to marry lizzy?"	53.18406677246094
wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.	52.88202667236328
is this to be endured!	67.20246124267578
lizzy, to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family!	66.07057189941406
"there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow
me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton?"	47.08917236328125
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	91.79802703857422
"i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.	53.185237884521484
i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	185.59059143066406
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	37.63196563720703
she dared not relate the other
half of mr darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	51.975833892822266
she repeated.	43.041465759277344
she was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	55.57786560058594
i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	70.60193634033203
"that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs bennet, "and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	50.17904281616211
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
bingley.	59.24208450317383
but she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.	61.29851150512695
such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	94.63833618164062
"but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."	61.18088912963867
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."	43.344852447509766
the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.	67.02487182617188
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	68.96366119384766
"i never heard any thing so
abominable.	30.47519302368164
the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	92.1662826538086
"but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for.	46.712730407714844
are quite well."	45.489105224609375
the
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	49.227882385253906
bingley was by no means deficient,
but darcy was clever.	63.837398529052734
i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn."	32.9468879699707
its completion depended on others.	68.88119506835938
and she was only sixteen last june.	41.19621658325195

"i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if _i_
should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia."	51.052154541015625
how thankful am i,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves.	51.074466705322266
and as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	89.2457275390625
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	55.76395797729492
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	79.20782470703125
she is grown so brown and coarse!	55.37259292602539
*       *       *       *       *

it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.	38.08523178100586
in society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	83.76791381835938
but mrs bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	52.860511779785156
he begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any
message to her.	35.788265228271484
what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	50.35992431640625
has she any family?"	50.4819450378418
"i am astonished, my dear," said mrs bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	38.11799621582031
lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.	74.70362091064453
it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	79.41139221191406
her report was highly favourable.	54.67805099487305
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil?	56.92117691040039
"i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	54.86130905151367
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	56.381935119628906
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.	54.660953521728516
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except mary agreed to go with her; and mr collins was to attend them,
at the request of mr bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither mr collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.	46.3151969909668
he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.	37.06110763549805
the
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."	36.38356018066406
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr darcy, who sat opposite to them.	50.04280471801758
he
comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday.	75.95880126953125
"and do you like her?"	44.82424545288086
it amazes
me, i confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.	82.85916137695312
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	73.80496215820312
she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	33.825347900390625
this was invitation enough.	105.4742431640625
"oh!	54.88862609863281
"yet why did he come?"	51.661319732666016
when is your turn to come?	35.11199951171875
mr bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!	66.83590698242188
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.	69.6763687133789
they met again on sunday, and
     then _i_ saw him too.	57.9033317565918
"tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	77.43247985839844
but the case is
this.	56.79450607299805
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.	51.6719856262207
on being made acquainted with the
present mr darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	47.740089416503906
in anticipating the happiness of bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	52.31781005859375
it will save me a world of trouble
and economy.	53.698848724365234
mr darcy walked off; and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	42.37125015258789
but however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	52.4110221862793
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley's."	58.45656967163086
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.	44.16238784790039
as for
their mother, mr collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.	89.56730651855469
"pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried mr collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	76.57422637939453
in spite of having been at st. james's, sir william was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	53.29915237426758
"in essentials, i believe, he is very much
what he ever was."	70.2547607421875
how rich
and how great you will be!	72.45800018310547
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	26.65277862548828
to be sure london was
rather thin, but however the little theatre was open.	57.57542419433594
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster's.	49.754058837890625
"oh!"	39.96797180175781
it is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like."	29.738094329833984
they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	57.31361770629883
miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	52.98804473876953
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	43.27793502807617
on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	35.04310607910156
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	68.88119506835938
it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	83.10810089111328
but i suppose you had no opportunity.	30.770322799682617
london:

military library, whitehall.	45.92605972290039
good bye.	43.284725189208984
she smiled, but made no answer.	33.7496337890625
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project
gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.	44.61256408691406
besides, there was truth in his
looks."	79.81182098388672
"that is not very likely; our authority was too good."	62.70496368408203
yes;--there is nothing in that.	37.935585021972656
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	76.26875305175781
four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.	41.511322021484375
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	48.29383850097656
and is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	66.67156219482422
jane was distressed.	80.43640899658203
darcy, after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	49.506744384765625
miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	31.410789489746094
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	64.42462158203125
"she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	61.0368537902832
_you_ cannot have
been always at longbourn."	33.82518768310547
by all that i have
ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	45.95442581176758
elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.	51.34305953979492
every body is disgusted with his pride.	29.614107131958008
it is mr bingley
i am sure.	129.96102905273438
1813.	98.54983520507812
my friend has an excellent understanding--though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	67.75230407714844
surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.	54.60673904418945
she had very little notice from any but him.	39.4685173034668
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	62.61956787109375
but perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	34.53374099731445
said he,
as he joined her.	126.56082153320312
mr bennet protested against any
description of finery.	75.19294738769531
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	64.32059478759766
we must not
all expect jane's good fortune."	37.71738815307617
"we
can all plague and punish one another.	73.01404571533203
the comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	55.812904357910156
here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	54.446102142333984
if _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"	67.92973327636719
and _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	67.64644622802734
elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	68.56941986083984
not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
i know are all chance in this world.	70.81743621826172
the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	194.16925048828125
but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for mrs bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	43.647796630859375
"how good it was in you, my dear mr bennet!	45.191307067871094
she
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.	52.02241516113281
letters of business too!	41.22016525268555
well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	39.92279815673828
will you be very angry with me, my dear
     lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
     enough to say before how much i like him.	35.523197174072266
"and pray
may i ask?"	53.640079498291016
she will be down in a moment i dare say."	93.93167877197266
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	74.62696838378906
"and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."	67.32202911376953
i cannot think so very ill of
wickham.	55.08357238769531
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	52.7994499206543
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	61.529972076416016
"well, well, and so mr bingley is coming down, sister," for mrs
philips first brought her the news.	66.30377197265625
and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.	54.89742660522461
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	55.63899230957031
"i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions."	39.38436508178711
charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	40.065208435058594
it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say
nothing of that.	59.04109573364258
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	51.148277282714844
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	77.35043334960938
"i will make no promise of the kind."	42.04792404174805
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton.	43.36328125
the next was in these words.	44.49253463745117
the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	65.98738098144531
when they repaired to the
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	69.6255874633789
repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."	55.33176803588867
"i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	64.10494995117188
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!	61.131431579589844
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire.	28.072038650512695
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg:

1.e.1.	57.92888259887695
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.	36.04555892944336
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.	67.85761260986328
"do you certainly leave kent on saturday?"	62.36000442504883
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	58.735721588134766
mr darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	67.89816284179688
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	51.083309173583984
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	56.91300964355469
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."	89.48585510253906
the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her.	44.83981704711914
"oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	33.57927322387695
it was very little less.	53.96138000488281
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	27.01725196838379
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	38.996177673339844
my mind was more
agreeably engaged.	44.11951446533203
well, any friend of
mr bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him."	55.605918884277344
you do not know what i suffer."	42.202423095703125
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to rosings.	114.52223205566406
"now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	54.867698669433594
jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.	49.75006103515625
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel
fitzwilliam.	34.89659881591797
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	39.30758285522461
"yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation!	42.806922912597656
1.f.	77.16885375976562
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets.	60.99341583251953
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	25.933626174926758
they are all for what they can get.	65.33333587646484
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	62.626583099365234
the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty.	171.8465118408203
_they_ will never be distressed
for money.	53.41591262817383
"yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	67.53516387939453
"yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	36.372802734375
"good god!	61.8126106262207
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.	86.5289306640625
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	72.84281158447266
anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	43.366920471191406
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	73.80496215820312
they
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	45.8294563293457
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."	26.474340438842773
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in
vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	69.13272857666016
"oh!	71.15686798095703
in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	55.78071212768555
how acutely did she now
feel it.	47.177127838134766
"my dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	43.1158447265625
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	45.81962203979492
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what
i learnt, to my own family!	40.653961181640625
he knows of my
     being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy.	88.30584716796875
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	50.02037811279297
mrs bennet's best
comfort was, that mr bingley must be down again in the summer.	45.659645080566406
i cannot do justice to his kindness.	46.32339096069336
the death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	49.1503791809082
"i hope," added mrs gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.	59.82205581665039
i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."	41.21255111694336
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth.	84.408203125
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	67.27295684814453
"i have not a doubt of mr bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	43.423099517822266
accompanied by a violent yawn.	56.41291427612305
but what is that to me?	21.65117835998535
she approached, and saw
the likeness of mr wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	67.04191589355469
"can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?"	114.60187530517578
but as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	58.871829986572266
his disposition must
be dreadful."	40.091087341308594
elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	40.96162033081055
"wickham so
very bad!	64.7119369506836
he then handed her
in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.	52.756099700927734
i have told miss bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
mrs collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often
told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
mrs jenkinson's room.	53.46623992919922
"but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.	45.343624114990234
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	54.76108169555664
"your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr darcy."	52.17807388305664
"i have said no such thing.	49.79195022583008
elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.	49.914981842041016
i could not have parted with
you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy."	62.69282531738281
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	34.61496353149414
"he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."	158.6727752685547

the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character!	51.510284423828125
how odious i should think them!"	54.22279357910156
good girl!	50.28341293334961
this
however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	42.04920959472656
he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	58.32979202270508
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	35.961585998535156
if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to mrs long.	44.17734146118164
"i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."	51.550506591796875
"he brought it with him for us to see."	115.68739318847656

the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s
regiment."	54.422569274902344
they were natural and just.	21.370113372802734
"yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	55.73291015625
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in
address that he improves?	64.39955139160156
she was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
     herself.	58.44324493408203
this will never do."	34.124454498291016
and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road."	50.7337760925293
but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	52.97282791137695
"i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on, than
that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it
be not so, let mr darcy contradict it.	23.273517608642578
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	44.679107666015625
i can recal nothing worse.	40.266944885253906
said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
youngest, i'm the tallest."	67.61681365966797
what is the matter?"	54.07509994506836
his letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.	58.463008880615234
i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."	51.804161071777344
mrs gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.	34.895084381103516
"i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."	49.48923110961914
but the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.	49.74211502075195
"you may well warn me against such an evil.	42.834678649902344
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	72.09193420410156
"pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing i believe.	66.4177474975586
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to london, before they procured lodgings.	54.126930236816406
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr
wickham's attentions.	54.24873352050781
the second began.	43.49225997924805
the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	78.66543579101562
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.	51.922393798828125
her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	59.738731384277344
"that is a question which mr darcy only can answer."	54.47311782836914
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	56.8995475769043
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	38.52256393432617
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	34.50804901123047
the
housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	58.499732971191406
"but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	47.36336898803711
"you are uniformly charming!"	65.82041931152344
as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	34.93804931640625
"_that_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness!	50.313838958740234
one may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	68.66108703613281
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.	35.898590087890625
why is not every body as happy?"	75.98633575439453
--and then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	42.76536178588867
she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.	61.64374923706055
what did colonel
forster say?	73.80496215820312
her ease and good
spirits increased.	26.211872100830078
they must be a great loss to _your_ family."	61.522701263427734
she is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished.	34.00117492675781
"oh!	98.55555725097656
both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	81.93866729736328
at that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	45.42247009277344
we neither of us perform to strangers."	46.766822814941406
"all!--what, all five out at once?	57.107730865478516
she added, "by far too much.	47.82395553588867
when mr
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte.	39.36274719238281
it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them
     both----"

"then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!"	35.507667541503906
for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions.	50.81956100463867
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?"	43.124427795410156
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
manner:--

"you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	59.97732162475586
"i wish it may."	103.25323486328125
the
gentlemen did approach; and when mr wickham walked into the room,
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	44.73662185668945
these are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as i thought myself privileged, for you.	71.79615020751953
mr bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	42.811031341552734
well, well, i only hope it
will last.	68.69174194335938
till i
can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_."	58.86649703979492
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found.	79.81988525390625
i must find mr gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; i have not an instant to lose."	51.81441116333008
mrs gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
openly.	45.8525276184082
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	47.268856048583984
oh, brother,
how kind you are!	39.500850677490234
"yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be.	45.28360366821289
mr collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day.	63.74915313720703
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care.	38.516265869140625
i
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	52.186622619628906
"i am, dear sir, &c. &c."

mr gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	36.0196533203125
can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	63.27423095703125
"it is _not_ mr bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life."	64.91888427734375
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much.	98.54983520507812
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.	71.4151382446289
had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	37.714935302734375
"my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	93.63312530517578
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	64.1251220703125
since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	53.023658752441406
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."	105.13721466064453
she then took a large house in edward-street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	79.47920989990234
"these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature.	44.96525573730469
but in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy's
pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend mr denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	60.05770492553711
he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	47.991817474365234
with _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!	66.9189453125
but now it comes out."	77.68521118164062
"colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	42.7286376953125
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"	49.75006103515625
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	58.62019348144531
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.	82.29166412353516
but if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, i must be more explicit.	76.19085693359375
1.d.	70.64791107177734
this cannot be!--engaged to mr darcy!	32.972389221191406
